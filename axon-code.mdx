Axon offers secure, production-ready AI models for both code generation and general-purpose tasks, leveraging pattern validation and organizational learning on GCP infrastructure.

<Tip>
Axon models are currently in beta with free 5M tokens, collectively for all Axon Models

### Key Features

- **Production Code**: Enterprise-grade, deployable code
- **Security**: OWASP compliance, vulnerability detection
- **Organizational Learning**: Adapts to codebase patterns
- **Data Privacy**: Client data isolation
- **Platform Integration**: Jira, GitHub, GitLab connectivity
- **Deep Reasoner**: Deep Reasoner Engine with search and web fetch tool calling
- **State Machine**: Manages complex workflows and transitions

## Deep Reasoner
Our State-of-the-Art Deep Reasoner Engine generates a detailed reasoning process for your requests, detects what needs to be done and how to do it, ensuring all the context is considered and the best possible solution is provided.

- **Multi-sources causal graph traversal** for inferencing across heterogeneous data sources, enabling root-cause analysis and counterfactual reasoning.
- **Dynamic symbolic grounding** via contextual ontologies to map abstract concepts into actionable knowledge representations in real time.
- **Probabilistic logic synthesis** with uncertainty quantification to evaluate solution optimality under incomplete or ambiguous input conditions.
- **Hierarchical attention over structured memory** to maintain long-range dependencies during complex, multi-step problem decomposition.
- **Meta-cognitive feedback loops** that refine internal heuristics based on outcome validation, improving future reasoning trajectories.
- **Real-time web search integration** with federated query optimization across multiple search providers for comprehensive knowledge retrieval.
- **Adaptive web content parsing** using semantic-aware scrapers that extract structured data from dynamic web sources while respecting rate limits and ToS.

## State Machine
Our State-of-the-Art State Machine Engine uses temporal memories to remember your continued flow of usage on what has accomplished and what needs to be completed next.

- **Hierarchical semi-Markov decision processes** (HSMDPs) for modeling variable-duration states and adaptive task sequencing.
- **Distributed state persistence with vector-clock reconciliation** to ensure consistency across asynchronous, concurrent user sessions.
- **Reinforcement learning-driven transition policies** that optimize long-term user goal completion over immediate action rewards.
- **Temporal difference learning over latent state embeddings** to predict and pre-fetch likely next states for zero-latency transitions.
- **Context-sensitive state compression** using learned subroutines to reduce combinatorial state explosion while preserving semantic fidelity.
