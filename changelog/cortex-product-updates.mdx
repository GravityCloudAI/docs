## New Features

### Similarity Search üîç
Similarity Search automatically reviews new or modified function calls in pull requests, comparing them to existing repository definitions. It verifies alignment with the function's contract (parameters, return value, side-effects). If a mismatch is found, it provides an inline suggestion detailing:
The issue: What's misused and why.
The fix: Minimal code changes needed.
The impact: Risks if the mismatch is deployed.
