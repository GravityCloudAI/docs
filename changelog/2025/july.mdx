# New Features

## Similarity Search üîç
Similarity Search automatically reviews new or modified function calls in pull requests, comparing them to existing repository definitions.

The issue: What‚Äôs misused and why.
The fix: Minimal code changes needed.
The impact: Risks if the mismatch is deployed.
