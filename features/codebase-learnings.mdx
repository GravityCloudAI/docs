## Overview

Codebase Learnings uses [Axon LLM](/axon-ai-code-gen) to create a Learning Map for each code file in a repository's default branch. These maps provide concise context for code reviews and generation, reducing token usage and improving LLM focus. Maps update automatically on new commits.

## Features

- **Automated Map Generation**: Axon LLM create structured Learning Maps
- **Dynamic Updates**: Maps refresh on new commits to the file
- **Optimized Context**: Concise maps reduce token usage for better LLM outputs
- **Structured Insights**: Includes file metadata, patterns, guidelines, testing, logic, and improvements
- **Scalable**: Handles large repos with Git integration

## Benefits

- Faster, accurate code gen and reviews
- Better code generation with relevant context
- Lower cognitive load for developers
- Consistent team standards
- Proactive code quality suggestions

## Use Cases

- **Code reviews**: Maps guide LLMs and developers
- **Code generation**: Ensures adherence to project standards
- **Onboarding**: Quick file context for new developers
- **Documentation**: Service-level automated documentation, per file search
- **Refactoring**: Guides improvements in quality and performance
