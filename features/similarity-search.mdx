## Overview

Similarity Search is an automatic review step that compares every new or modified function call **in your pull request** with existing definitions across the repository.  
It then checks whether the way the engineer is *using* that function matches the original implementation’s contract (required parameters, return value, side-effects, etc.).

When a mismatch is detected, the reviewer leaves an inline suggestion that pin-points:

1. The **issue** – what is being mis-used and why.
2. The **fix** – the minimal code change required to align the call-site with the definition.
3. The potential **impact** if the mismatch is shipped.

> **Example**
> The screenshot below shows `isValidUrl` being invoked with two parameters even though its definition only accepts one.
> Similarity Search detected the mismatch and suggested the one-line fix.

## How it works

We use [ast-grep](https://github.com/ast-grep/ast-grep) for syntax-aware matching between new or modified call-sites and existing symbol definitions across the repository.

## Why you’ll love it

- **Catch bugs early** – Prevent invalid API usage before it reaches CI.
- **Shorter reviews** – Focus human reviewers on architectural decisions, not boilerplate mistakes.
- **Faster onboarding** – New engineers quickly learn correct library usage by example.

## Enable / disable

Similarity Search is **on by default** for all repositories. You can use the setting `Enable Similarity Search` option in the Matter AI configurations to enable or disable it.

## Supported languages

- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Python
- Go
- Java
- Kotlin
- Python
- C# / C++
- Rust

## Limitations & future work
- Only analyses intra-repository symbols today, cross-repo support is on the roadmap using Semantic Search.
