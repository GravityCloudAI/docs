## Language Rules

Language Rules allow you to define how Matter AI should review code written in specific programming languages. These rules help ensure that your team follows consistent coding standards, patterns, and best practices specific to each language in your tech stack.

With Language Rules, you can:

- **Define language-specific standards**: Create custom rules for Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, and other languages your team uses
- **Enforce coding conventions**: Specify naming conventions, formatting preferences, and structural patterns
- **Prioritize review focus**: Tell Matter AI which aspects of the code deserve more attention during reviews
- **Customize feedback style**: Configure how detailed or concise the AI's feedback should be for each language
- **Implement team-specific practices**: Align reviews with your team's unique development methodologies

## Security Rules

Security Rules enable you to define how Matter AI should evaluate code for potential security vulnerabilities and compliance issues. These rules help your team maintain robust security standards across your codebase.

With Security Rules, you can:

- **Target specific vulnerabilities**: Configure the AI to focus on particular security concerns relevant to your applications
- **Implement compliance checks**: Ensure code adheres to industry standards like OWASP, GDPR, HIPAA, etc.
- **Set severity thresholds**: Define what level of security issues should trigger alerts
- **Customize security contexts**: Create different security rule profiles for different parts of your application
- **Integrate with security workflows**: Align AI reviews with your existing security practices and tools

## Repository Rules

Repository Rules allow you to configure how Matter AI interacts with specific repositories in your organization. These rules help you tailor the review process to the unique requirements of each project.

With Repository Rules, you can:

- **Set repository-specific priorities**: Define what aspects of code should be emphasized in reviews for each repo
- **Configure branch policies**: Create different review standards for different branches
- **Customize PR workflows**: Define how Matter AI should participate in your pull request process
- **Set exclusion patterns**: Specify files or directories that should be excluded from AI review
