## Auto Resolving

- Comment reviews as Resolved: On new commits, if previously reviewed issues are resolved, MatterAI comments on them as âœ… Resolved along with a resolution reason.
- Mark conversations as Resolved: On new commits, if previously reviewed issues are resolved, MatterAI marks the conversation as resolved along with a resolution reason.

### Benefits
1. Save engineers time to add a comment and resolve the issue
2. Saves time to validate if the fix is actually resolved in the new commits. Only works for AI code reviews that are generated by MatterAI.
