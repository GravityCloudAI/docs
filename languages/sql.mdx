  <Accordion title="SQL Anti-Patterns Overview" icon="sql">
    SQL, despite being a powerful language for database operations, has several common anti-patterns that can lead to performance issues, security vulnerabilities, and maintainability problems. Here are the most important anti-patterns to avoid when writing SQL code.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using SELECT *" icon="warning">
    ```sql
    -- Anti-pattern: Using SELECT *
    SELECT * FROM customers
    JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
    
    -- Better approach: Specify only needed columns
    SELECT 
        customers.customer_id,
        customers.first_name,
        customers.last_name,
        orders.order_id,
        orders.order_date,
        orders.total_amount
    FROM customers
    JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
    ```
    Avoid using `SELECT *` in production code. Instead, explicitly list the columns you need. This improves performance by reducing I/O and network traffic, prevents issues when table schemas change, and makes your code more maintainable by clearly showing which columns are being used.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Parameterized Queries" icon="warning">
    ```sql
    -- Anti-pattern: String concatenation for dynamic SQL
    -- (Pseudocode mixing application code and SQL)
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "' AND password = '" + password + "'";
    
    -- Better approach: Use parameterized queries
    -- In a prepared statement (syntax varies by language/framework)
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?";
    execute_query(query, [username, password]);
    
    -- Or using stored procedures
    CREATE PROCEDURE authenticate_user
        @username VARCHAR(50),
        @password VARCHAR(100)
    AS
    BEGIN
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = @username AND password = @password;
    END;
    ```
    Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of concatenating strings to build SQL queries. This prevents SQL injection attacks and improves performance through query plan caching.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Inefficient Joins" icon="warning">
    ```sql
    -- Anti-pattern: Cartesian product (implicit cross join)
    SELECT customers.name, orders.order_id
    FROM customers, orders
    WHERE customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
    
    -- Better approach: Explicit JOIN syntax
    SELECT customers.name, orders.order_id
    FROM customers
    JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
    
    -- Anti-pattern: Joining unnecessary tables
    SELECT customers.name, orders.order_id
    FROM customers
    JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
    JOIN order_items ON orders.order_id = order_items.order_id
    JOIN products ON order_items.product_id = products.product_id;
    -- ^ Products table isn't needed if we're not using any columns from it
    
    -- Better approach: Only join necessary tables
    SELECT customers.name, orders.order_id
    FROM customers
    JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
    ```
    Use explicit JOIN syntax instead of implicit joins in the WHERE clause. Only join tables that are necessary for your query. Unnecessary joins can dramatically decrease performance, especially with large tables.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Indexes Properly" icon="warning">
    ```sql
    -- Anti-pattern: Not indexing columns used in WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY
    SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123;
    -- If customer_id isn't indexed, this will perform a full table scan
    
    -- Better approach: Create appropriate indexes
    CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_id ON orders(customer_id);
    
    -- Anti-pattern: Using functions on indexed columns
    SELECT * FROM customers WHERE LOWER(email) = 'user@example.com';
    -- Index on email won't be used because of the LOWER function
    
    -- Better approach: Avoid functions on indexed columns
    SELECT * FROM customers WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
    -- Or create a functional index if your DBMS supports it
    CREATE INDEX idx_customers_email_lower ON customers(LOWER(email));
    ```
    Create appropriate indexes for columns used in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, and ORDER BY statements. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in WHERE conditions, as this can prevent the optimizer from using the index.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using DISTINCT Unnecessarily" icon="warning">
    ```sql
    -- Anti-pattern: Using DISTINCT to hide join problems
    SELECT DISTINCT customers.customer_id, customers.name
    FROM customers
    JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
    
    -- Better approach: Fix the join to avoid duplicates
    SELECT customers.customer_id, customers.name
    FROM customers
    JOIN (
        SELECT DISTINCT customer_id FROM orders
    ) o ON customers.customer_id = o.customer_id;
    
    -- Or even better, if you just want customers who have orders:
    SELECT customers.customer_id, customers.name
    FROM customers
    WHERE EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM orders WHERE orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
    );
    ```
    Avoid using DISTINCT as a quick fix for duplicate rows. It can hide join problems and hurt performance. Instead, fix the underlying issue by using the correct join type or restructuring your query.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Cursors Instead of Set-Based Operations" icon="warning">
    ```sql
    -- Anti-pattern: Using cursors for row-by-row processing
    DECLARE @customer_id INT;
    DECLARE @total_spent DECIMAL(10, 2);
    
    DECLARE customer_cursor CURSOR FOR
    SELECT customer_id FROM customers;
    
    OPEN customer_cursor;
    FETCH NEXT FROM customer_cursor INTO @customer_id;
    
    WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
    BEGIN
        SELECT @total_spent = SUM(total_amount)
        FROM orders
        WHERE customer_id = @customer_id;
        
        UPDATE customers
        SET total_spent = @total_spent
        WHERE customer_id = @customer_id;
        
        FETCH NEXT FROM customer_cursor INTO @customer_id;
    END
    
    CLOSE customer_cursor;
    DEALLOCATE customer_cursor;
    
    -- Better approach: Use set-based operations
    UPDATE customers
    SET total_spent = (
        SELECT SUM(total_amount)
        FROM orders
        WHERE orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
    );
    ```
    Avoid using cursors for row-by-row processing when set-based operations can accomplish the same task. Set-based operations are typically much faster and more efficient in SQL.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Appropriate Data Types" icon="warning">
    ```sql
    -- Anti-pattern: Using inappropriate data types
    CREATE TABLE products (
        product_id VARCHAR(50),  -- Using VARCHAR for a numeric ID
        price VARCHAR(10),       -- Using VARCHAR for a numeric price
        created_at VARCHAR(20)   -- Using VARCHAR for a date/time
    );
    
    -- Better approach: Use appropriate data types
    CREATE TABLE products (
        product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        price DECIMAL(10, 2),
        created_at TIMESTAMP
    );
    ```
    Use appropriate data types for your columns. Using the wrong data type can lead to unexpected behavior, poor performance, and increased storage requirements. For example, use numeric types for numbers, date/time types for dates, and VARCHAR only for variable-length strings.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Storing Comma-Separated Values" icon="warning">
    ```sql
    -- Anti-pattern: Storing comma-separated values
    CREATE TABLE users (
        user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(100),
        roles VARCHAR(255)  -- Stores roles like 'admin,editor,viewer'
    );
    
    -- Querying for users with a specific role is difficult
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE roles LIKE '%admin%';
    -- This could match 'admin', but also 'administrator' or 'badmin'
    
    -- Better approach: Normalize the data
    CREATE TABLE users (
        user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(100)
    );
    
    CREATE TABLE roles (
        role_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        role_name VARCHAR(50)
    );
    
    CREATE TABLE user_roles (
        user_id INT,
        role_id INT,
        PRIMARY KEY (user_id, role_id),
        FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id),
        FOREIGN KEY (role_id) REFERENCES roles(role_id)
    );
    
    -- Now querying for users with a specific role is straightforward
    SELECT u.user_id, u.name
    FROM users u
    JOIN user_roles ur ON u.user_id = ur.user_id
    JOIN roles r ON ur.role_id = r.role_id
    WHERE r.role_name = 'admin';
    ```
    Avoid storing comma-separated values in a single column. This violates first normal form and makes it difficult to query, update, and maintain data integrity. Instead, normalize your data by creating appropriate related tables.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Transactions" icon="warning">
    ```sql
    -- Anti-pattern: Not using transactions for multi-statement operations
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 123;
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 456;
    -- If the second statement fails, the first one still goes through
    
    -- Better approach: Use transactions
    BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 123;
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 456;
    
    -- Check if both updates succeeded
    IF @@ROWCOUNT > 0
        COMMIT TRANSACTION;
    ELSE
        ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
    ```
    Use transactions for operations that require multiple statements to be executed as a single unit. This ensures data consistency and integrity, especially for operations like transfers or complex updates.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using NOT IN with NULL Values" icon="warning">
    ```sql
    -- Anti-pattern: Using NOT IN with a subquery that might return NULL
    SELECT * FROM customers
    WHERE customer_id NOT IN (SELECT customer_id FROM orders WHERE total_amount > 1000);
    
    -- Better approach: Use NOT EXISTS or LEFT JOIN / IS NULL
    -- Option 1: NOT EXISTS
    SELECT * FROM customers c
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM orders o
        WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id AND o.total_amount > 1000
    );
    
    -- Option 2: LEFT JOIN / IS NULL
    SELECT c.*
    FROM customers c
    LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id AND o.total_amount > 1000
    WHERE o.order_id IS NULL;
    ```
    Avoid using NOT IN with a subquery that might return NULL values. In SQL, comparing anything to NULL using NOT IN returns UNKNOWN, which is treated as FALSE in a WHERE clause. Use NOT EXISTS or LEFT JOIN / IS NULL instead.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using COUNT(*) to Check Existence" icon="warning">
    ```sql
    -- Anti-pattern: Using COUNT(*) to check existence
    IF (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123) > 0
        -- Customer has orders
    ELSE
        -- Customer has no orders
    
    -- Better approach: Use EXISTS
    IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123)
        -- Customer has orders
    ELSE
        -- Customer has no orders
    ```
    Use EXISTS instead of COUNT(*) to check if records exist. EXISTS is more efficient because it stops scanning as soon as it finds a matching record, while COUNT(*) needs to scan all matching records.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using OFFSET for Pagination" icon="warning">
    ```sql
    -- Anti-pattern: Using OFFSET for pagination with large offsets
    SELECT * FROM products
    ORDER BY product_id
    LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10000;
    
    -- Better approach: Use keyset pagination
    -- Assuming the last product_id from the previous page was 10000
    SELECT * FROM products
    WHERE product_id > 10000
    ORDER BY product_id
    LIMIT 10;
    ```
    Avoid using OFFSET for pagination with large offset values. OFFSET requires the database to scan and discard all rows up to the offset, which becomes increasingly inefficient as the offset grows. Use keyset pagination (also known as cursor-based pagination) instead, which uses a filter on the last seen value.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using OR Conditions on Different Columns" icon="warning">
    ```sql
    -- Anti-pattern: Using OR conditions on different columns
    SELECT * FROM products
    WHERE category = 'Electronics' OR brand = 'Samsung';
    
    -- Better approach: Use UNION
    SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Electronics'
    UNION
    SELECT * FROM products WHERE brand = 'Samsung';
    ```
    Consider using UNION instead of OR conditions on different columns, especially if you have indexes on those columns. The optimizer can use different indexes for each part of the UNION, potentially improving performance.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs)" icon="warning">
    ```sql
    -- Anti-pattern: Repeating complex subqueries
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        (
            SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders
            WHERE orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
        ) AS order_count,
        (
            SELECT SUM(total_amount) FROM orders
            WHERE orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
        ) AS total_spent
    FROM customers;
    
    -- Better approach: Use Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
    WITH customer_orders AS (
        SELECT
            customer_id,
            COUNT(*) AS order_count,
            SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
        FROM orders
        GROUP BY customer_id
    )
    SELECT
        c.customer_id,
        co.order_count,
        co.total_spent
    FROM customers c
    LEFT JOIN customer_orders co ON c.customer_id = co.customer_id;
    ```
    Use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to simplify complex queries, improve readability, and avoid repeating subqueries. CTEs can also be recursive, which is useful for hierarchical data.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Implicit Conversions" icon="warning">
    ```sql
    -- Anti-pattern: Implicit conversions
    SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_id = '1000';
    -- order_id is an INT, but we're comparing it to a string
    
    -- Better approach: Use explicit conversions or correct types
    SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_id = 1000;
    -- Or if you need to convert
    SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_id = CAST('1000' AS INT);
    ```
    Avoid implicit conversions between different data types. They can prevent the optimizer from using indexes and lead to unexpected results. Use the correct data type in your queries or explicit conversions when necessary.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Scalar User-Defined Functions in WHERE Clauses" icon="warning">
    ```sql
    -- Anti-pattern: Using scalar UDFs in WHERE clauses
    CREATE FUNCTION dbo.GetFullName(@FirstName VARCHAR(50), @LastName VARCHAR(50))
    RETURNS VARCHAR(101)
    AS
    BEGIN
        RETURN @FirstName + ' ' + @LastName;
    END;
    
    SELECT * FROM employees
    WHERE dbo.GetFullName(first_name, last_name) = 'John Doe';
    
    -- Better approach: Inline the function logic
    SELECT * FROM employees
    WHERE first_name + ' ' + last_name = 'John Doe';
    ```
    Avoid using scalar user-defined functions in WHERE clauses. They can prevent the optimizer from using indexes and are executed once per row, which can severely impact performance. Inline the function logic directly in your query when possible.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Schema Names" icon="warning">
    ```sql
    -- Anti-pattern: Not using schema names
    SELECT * FROM customers;
    
    -- Better approach: Always use schema names
    SELECT * FROM dbo.customers;
    ```
    Always use schema names when referencing database objects. This improves query plan caching, prevents ambiguity if multiple schemas have objects with the same name, and makes your code more maintainable.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Table Variables When Temporary Tables Would Be Better" icon="warning">
    ```sql
    -- Anti-pattern: Using table variables for large result sets
    DECLARE @LargeResults TABLE (
        ID INT,
        Name VARCHAR(100),
        Value DECIMAL(10, 2)
    );
    
    INSERT INTO @LargeResults
    SELECT ID, Name, Value FROM SomeLargeTable;
    
    -- Better approach: Use temporary tables for large result sets
    CREATE TABLE #LargeResults (
        ID INT,
        Name VARCHAR(100),
        Value DECIMAL(10, 2)
    );
    
    CREATE INDEX IX_LargeResults_ID ON #LargeResults(ID);
    
    INSERT INTO #LargeResults
    SELECT ID, Name, Value FROM SomeLargeTable;
    ```
    Use temporary tables (#temp) instead of table variables (@table) for large result sets or when you need indexes. Table variables store statistics only when they're created and don't support indexes (in most database systems), which can lead to poor query plans for large datasets.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using DELETE Without WHERE" icon="warning">
    ```sql
    -- Anti-pattern: Using DELETE without WHERE
    DELETE FROM orders;
    
    -- Better approach: Always include a WHERE clause
    DELETE FROM orders WHERE order_date < '2020-01-01';
    
    -- If you really want to delete all rows, be explicit
    TRUNCATE TABLE orders; -- Faster than DELETE without WHERE
    ```
    Always include a WHERE clause with DELETE statements unless you explicitly want to delete all rows. If you do want to delete all rows, use TRUNCATE TABLE, which is faster and uses fewer system resources.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using MERGE for Upserts" icon="warning">
    ```sql
    -- Anti-pattern: Using separate INSERT/UPDATE for upserts
    IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 123)
        UPDATE customers
        SET name = 'John Doe', email = 'john@example.com'
        WHERE customer_id = 123;
    ELSE
        INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, name, email)
        VALUES (123, 'John Doe', 'john@example.com');
    
    -- Better approach: Use MERGE for upserts
    MERGE INTO customers AS target
    USING (SELECT 123 AS customer_id, 'John Doe' AS name, 'john@example.com' AS email) AS source
    ON target.customer_id = source.customer_id
    WHEN MATCHED THEN
        UPDATE SET name = source.name, email = source.email
    WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
        INSERT (customer_id, name, email)
        VALUES (source.customer_id, source.name, source.email);
    ```
    Use the MERGE statement for upsert operations (insert if not exists, update if exists) instead of separate INSERT and UPDATE statements. MERGE is more efficient and atomic, reducing the risk of race conditions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Non-Standard SQL" icon="warning">
    ```sql
    -- Anti-pattern: Using database-specific features without necessity
    -- SQL Server specific:
    SELECT TOP 10 * FROM products ORDER BY price DESC;
    
    -- Better approach: Use standard SQL when possible
    -- Standard SQL (works in most databases):
    SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 10;
    ```
    Use standard SQL features when possible to make your code more portable across different database systems. If you do need to use database-specific features, document them clearly and consider abstracting them in a way that makes them easier to change if needed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Appropriate Constraints" icon="warning">
    ```sql
    -- Anti-pattern: Not using appropriate constraints
    CREATE TABLE orders (
        order_id INT,
        customer_id INT,
        order_date DATE,
        total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
    );
    
    -- Better approach: Use appropriate constraints
    CREATE TABLE orders (
        order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        customer_id INT NOT NULL,
        order_date DATE NOT NULL,
        total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL CHECK (total_amount >= 0),
        FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
    );
    ```
    Use appropriate constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK) to enforce data integrity at the database level. This prevents invalid data from being inserted and makes your database more reliable.
