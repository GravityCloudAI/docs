  <Accordion title="Racket Anti-Patterns Overview" icon="racket">
    Racket, despite being a well-designed language with powerful features, has several common anti-patterns that can lead to code that's difficult to maintain, inefficient, or doesn't follow the language's idioms. Here are the most important anti-patterns to avoid when writing Racket code.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Excessive Mutation" icon="warning">
    ```racket
    ;; Anti-pattern: Excessive mutation
    (define (sum-list lst)
      (let ([total 0])
        (for-each (lambda (x) (set! total (+ total x))) lst)
        total))
    
    ;; Better approach: Use functional constructs
    (define (sum-list lst)
      (foldl + 0 lst))
    ```
    Avoid excessive use of mutation (`set!`, mutable variables, etc.) and imperative loops. Racket is primarily a functional language, so prefer immutable data and functional constructs like recursion, `map`, `filter`, and `foldl`.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Contracts" icon="warning">
    ```racket
    ;; Anti-pattern: Not using contracts
    (define (divide a b)
      (/ a b))
    
    ;; Usage that might raise an exception
    (divide 10 0) ; Division by zero
    
    ;; Better approach: Use contracts
    (require racket/contract)
    
    (define/contract (divide a b)
      (-> number? (and/c number? (not/c zero?)) number?)
      (/ a b))
    
    ;; Now this will raise a contract violation, not a division by zero
    (divide 10 0)
    ```
    Use Racket's contract system to specify and enforce the requirements and guarantees of your functions. Contracts provide better error messages and help catch bugs earlier.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Pattern Matching" icon="warning">
    ```racket
    ;; Anti-pattern: Not using pattern matching
    (define (factorial n)
      (if (= n 0)
          1
          (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
    
    (define (process-shape shape)
      (cond
        [(eq? (car shape) 'circle)
         (let ([radius (cadr shape)])
           (* pi radius radius))]
        [(eq? (car shape) 'rectangle)
         (let ([width (cadr shape)]
               [height (caddr shape)])
           (* width height))]
        [else 0]))
    
    ;; Better approach: Use pattern matching
    (require racket/match)
    
    (define (factorial n)
      (match n
        [0 1]
        [_ (* n (factorial (- n 1)))]))
    
    (define (process-shape shape)
      (match shape
        [(list 'circle radius)
         (* pi radius radius)]
        [(list 'rectangle width height)
         (* width height)]
        [_ 0]))
    ```
    Use pattern matching to make your code more concise and readable. Racket's `match` form provides powerful pattern matching capabilities that can simplify complex conditional logic.

  <Accordion title="Not Using Modules" icon="warning">
    ```racket
    ;; Anti-pattern: Everything in one file without modules
    
    ;; Better approach: Use modules to organize code
    #lang racket
    
    (provide (all-defined-out))
    
    ;; Module for geometric calculations
    (module geometry racket
      (provide (all-defined-out))
      
      (define pi 3.14159)
      
      (define (circle-area radius)
        (* pi radius radius))
      
      (define (rectangle-area width height)
        (* width height)))
    
    ;; Module for user interface
    (module ui racket
      (provide display-result)
      
      (define (display-result shape area)
        (printf "The area of the ~a is ~a\n" shape area)))
    
    ;; Main module
    (require 'geometry)
    (require 'ui)
    
    (define (process-shape shape)
      (match shape
        [(list 'circle radius)
         (display-result 'circle (circle-area radius))]
        [(list 'rectangle width height)
         (display-result 'rectangle (rectangle-area width height))]))
    ```
    Organize your code into modules with well-defined interfaces. This improves maintainability, reduces naming conflicts, and allows for better encapsulation of implementation details.

  <Accordion title="Not Using Racket's Data Structures" icon="warning">
    ```racket
    ;; Anti-pattern: Using lists for everything
    (define (find-user users id)
      (for/first ([user users] #:when (equal? (car user) id))
        user))
    
    (define (user-exists? users id)
      (for/or ([user users])
        (equal? (car user) id)))
    
    ;; Better approach: Use appropriate data structures
    (require racket/dict)
    
    ;; Using hash tables for key-based lookups
    (define users (hash 'john (list "John Doe" "john@example.com")
                       'jane (list "Jane Smith" "jane@example.com")))
    
    (define (find-user users id)
      (dict-ref users id #f))
    
    (define (user-exists? users id)
      (dict-has-key? users id))
    
    ;; Using structs for domain objects
    (struct user (id name email) #:transparent)
    
    (define users
      (list (user 'john "John Doe" "john@example.com")
            (user 'jane "Jane Smith" "jane@example.com")))
    
    (define (find-user-by-id users id)
      (for/first ([u users] #:when (eq? (user-id u) id))
        u))
    ```
    Use appropriate data structures for your needs. Racket provides a rich set of data structures including hash tables, sets, vectors, and structs. Choose the right data structure for your use case instead of using lists for everything.

  <Accordion title="Not Using Macros Effectively" icon="warning">
    ```racket
    ;; Anti-pattern: Duplicated code that could be abstracted with macros
    (define-values (input-port output-port) (make-pipe))
    
    (with-handlers ([exn:fail? (lambda (e) (close-input-port input-port)

      (close-output-port output-port))
    
    ;; Another similar pattern elsewhere...
    (define-values (in out) (make-pipe))
    
    (with-handlers ([exn:fail? (lambda (e) (close-input-port in)
                                       (close-output-port out)

      (define-values (in out) (make-pipe))
      (dynamic-wind
        (lambda () (void))
        (lambda () body ...)
        (lambda ()
          (close-input-port in)
          (close-output-port out))))
    
    ;; Usage
    (with-pipe (input-port output-port)
      (process-data input-port output-port))
    
    (with-pipe (in out)
      (process-more-data in out))
    ```
    Use macros to abstract common patterns and eliminate boilerplate code. Racket's macro system is powerful and can help you create cleaner, more maintainable code.

  <Accordion title="Not Using Higher-Order Functions" icon="warning">
    ```racket
    ;; Anti-pattern: Duplicated code for similar operations
    (define (sum-list lst)
      (if (null? lst)
          0
          (+ (car lst) (sum-list (cdr lst)))))
    
    (define (product-list lst)
      (if (null? lst)
          1
          (* (car lst) (product-list (cdr lst)))))
    
    ;; Better approach: Use higher-order functions
    (define (fold-list f init lst)
      (if (null? lst)
          init
          (f (car lst) (fold-list f init (cdr lst)))))
    
    (define (sum-list lst)
      (fold-list + 0 lst))
    
    (define (product-list lst)
      (fold-list * 1 lst))
    
    ;; Or better yet, use built-in functions
    (define (sum-list lst)
      (foldl + 0 lst))
    
    (define (product-list lst)
      (foldl * 1 lst))
    ```
    Use higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, `foldl`, and `foldr` to abstract common patterns and reduce code duplication. Racket provides these functions in its standard library.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Tail Recursion" icon="warning">
    ```racket
    ;; Anti-pattern: Recursion without tail calls
    (define (factorial n)
      (if (= n 0)
          1
          (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
    
    ;; Better approach: Use tail recursion
    (define (factorial n)
      (let loop ([n n] [acc 1])
        (if (= n 0)
            acc
            (loop (- n 1) (* n acc)))))
    ```
    When using recursion, make your functions tail-recursive to avoid stack overflow errors with large inputs. In a tail-recursive function, the recursive call is the last operation in the function.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Proper Error Handling" icon="warning">
    ```racket
    ;; Anti-pattern: Poor error handling
    (define (process-file filename)

        (let ([data (read-all-data in)])
          (close-input-port in)
          (process-data data))))
    
    ;; Better approach: Use with-handlers or dynamic-wind
    (define (process-file filename)
      (with-handlers ([exn:fail:filesystem?
                        (lambda (e)
                          (printf "File error: ~a\n" (exn-message e))
                          #f)])
        (call-with-input-file filename
          (lambda (in)
            (let ([data (read-all-data in)])
              (process-data data))))))
    
    ;; Or using dynamic-wind for cleanup
    (define (process-file filename)
      (let ([in #f])
        (dynamic-wind
          (lambda () (set! in (open-input-file filename)))

                      (process-data data)))
          (lambda () (when in (close-input-port in))))))
    ```
    Implement proper error handling in your code. Use `with-handlers` to catch and handle exceptions, and ensure resources are properly cleaned up using `dynamic-wind` or higher-level abstractions like `call-with-input-file`.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Racket's Iteration Constructs" icon="warning">
    ```racket
    ;; Anti-pattern: Manual recursion for iteration
    (define (sum-integers-up-to n)
      (let loop ([i 1] [sum 0])
        (if (> i n)
            sum
            (loop (+ i 1) (+ sum i)))))
    
    ;; Better approach: Use for/fold and other iteration forms
    (define (sum-integers-up-to n)
      (for/fold ([sum 0]) ([i (in-range 1 (+ n 1))])
        (+ sum i)))
    
    ;; Or even simpler
    (define (sum-integers-up-to n)
      (for/sum ([i (in-range 1 (+ n 1))])
        i))
    ```
    Use Racket's rich set of iteration constructs like `for/list`, `for/vector`, `for/sum`, `for/fold`, etc., instead of writing manual recursive loops. These forms are more concise and often more readable.

  <Accordion title="Not Using Typed Racket" icon="warning">
    ```racket
    ;; Anti-pattern: Runtime type errors
    #lang racket

    #lang typed/racket
    
    (: add-numbers (-> Number Number Number))
    (define (add-numbers a b)
      (+ a b))
    
    ;; This would be a type error at compile time
    ;; (add-numbers "not a number" 42)
    ```
    Consider using Typed Racket for projects where type safety is important. Typed Racket adds static type checking to Racket, catching type errors at compile time rather than runtime.
