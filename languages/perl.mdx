  <Accordion title="Perl Anti-Patterns Overview" icon="perl">
    Perl, despite its flexibility and power, has several common anti-patterns that can lead to code that is difficult to maintain, debug, and understand. Here are the most important anti-patterns to avoid when writing Perl code.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using strict and warnings" icon="warning">
    ```perl
    # Anti-pattern: Not using strict and warnings
    $name = "John";
    $greeting = "Hello, $anme!"; # Typo in variable name, but no warning
    print $greeting;
    
    # Better approach: Always use strict and warnings
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    
    my $name = "John";
    my $greeting = "Hello, $name!";
    print $greeting;
    ```
    Always use `use strict;` and `use warnings;` at the beginning of your Perl scripts. These pragmas help catch common programming errors like typos in variable names, using undefined variables, and other potential issues.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Barewords" icon="warning">
    ```perl
    # Anti-pattern: Using barewords
    $result = open(FILE, "data.txt");
    
    # Better approach: Use quotes for strings and lexical filehandles
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    
    open(my $fh, '<', "data.txt") or die "Cannot open data.txt: $!";
    ```
    Avoid using barewords (unquoted strings) in your code. They can lead to confusion and errors, especially when they match built-in function names or when used as hash keys.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Checking Return Values" icon="warning">
    ```perl
    # Anti-pattern: Not checking return values
    open(my $fh, '<', "data.txt");
    while (my $line = <$fh>) {
        # Process line...
    }
    close($fh);
    
    # Better approach: Check return values and handle errors
    open(my $fh, '<', "data.txt") or die "Cannot open data.txt: $!";
    while (my $line = <$fh>) {
        # Process line...
    }
    close($fh) or warn "Error closing file: $!";
    ```
    Always check return values from functions that can fail, such as file operations, database connections, and network calls. Use `or die` or `or warn` to handle errors appropriately.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Two-Argument open" icon="warning">
    ```perl
    # Anti-pattern: Using two-argument open
    open(my $fh, "data.txt"); # Ambiguous mode
    open(my $fh, ">data.txt"); # Security risk with filenames containing special characters
    
    # Better approach: Use three-argument open
    open(my $fh, '<', "data.txt") or die "Cannot open data.txt: $!";
    open(my $fh, '>', "output.txt") or die "Cannot open output.txt: $!";
    ```
    Always use the three-argument form of `open()` instead of the two-argument form. The three-argument form explicitly separates the mode from the filename, making your code safer and more readable.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Lexical Variables" icon="warning">
    ```perl
    # Anti-pattern: Using global variables
    $count = 0;
    sub increment {
        $count++;
        return $count;
    }
    
    # Better approach: Use lexical variables with my
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    
    my $count = 0;
    sub increment {
        my $local_count = shift;
        return $local_count + 1;
    }
    $count = increment($count);
    ```
    Use lexical variables (declared with `my`) instead of global variables. Lexical variables have limited scope, making your code more maintainable and less prone to bugs from unexpected variable modifications.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Symbolic References" icon="warning">
    ```perl
    # Anti-pattern: Using symbolic references
    $var_name = "count";
    $$var_name = 42; # Sets $count to 42
    
    # Better approach: Use hash references
    use strict; # This would prevent the above code from working
    use warnings;
    
    my %vars = (count => 42);
    print $vars{count};
    ```
    Avoid using symbolic references (using variable names stored in other variables). They make code harder to understand and maintain. Use hash references instead.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Comma as Statement Separator" icon="warning">
    ```perl
    # Anti-pattern: Using comma as statement separator
    print "Hello", print " World\n";
    
    # Better approach: Use semicolons
    print "Hello";
    print " World\n";
    
    # Or concatenate strings
    print "Hello World\n";
    ```
    Don't use commas as statement separators. Use semicolons to separate statements for clarity and to avoid confusion with list elements.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Proper Error Handling" icon="warning">
    ```perl
    # Anti-pattern: Poor error handling
    eval {
        # Some code that might die
        die "Something went wrong" if $error;
    };
    if ($@) {
        print "Error: $@";
    }
    
    # Better approach: Use Try::Tiny or similar
    use Try::Tiny;
    
    try {
        # Some code that might die
        die "Something went wrong" if $error;
    } catch {
        warn "Error: $_";
        # Handle error...
    } finally {
        # Clean up, always executed
    };
    ```
    Use proper error handling with modules like `Try::Tiny` instead of bare `eval` blocks. This helps avoid subtle issues with `$@` and ensures proper error propagation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Perl4-style File Handles" icon="warning">
    ```perl
    # Anti-pattern: Using Perl4-style file handles
    open(FH, '<', "data.txt") or die "Cannot open data.txt: $!";
    while (<FH>) {
        # Process line...
    }
    close(FH);
    
    # Better approach: Use lexical file handles
    open(my $fh, '<', "data.txt") or die "Cannot open data.txt: $!";
    while (my $line = <$fh>) {
        # Process line...
    }
    close($fh);
    ```
    Use lexical filehandles (declared with `my`) instead of global filehandles. Lexical filehandles are automatically closed when they go out of scope, reducing the risk of resource leaks.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Modules" icon="warning">
    ```perl
    # Anti-pattern: Reinventing the wheel
    sub parse_json {
        my $json_str = shift;
        # Complex, error-prone parsing code...
    }
    
    # Better approach: Use existing modules
    use JSON::PP;
    
    my $data = decode_json($json_str);
    ```
    Don't reinvent the wheel. Use existing modules from CPAN for common tasks like parsing JSON, handling HTTP requests, or processing XML.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Indirect Object Syntax" icon="warning">
    ```perl
    # Anti-pattern: Using indirect object syntax
    $obj = new MyClass(arg1 => "value1");
    
    # Better approach: Use direct method calls
    $obj = MyClass->new(arg1 => "value1");
    ```
    Avoid using indirect object syntax for method calls. Use the arrow (`->`) notation instead, which is clearer and less ambiguous.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Named Parameters" icon="warning">
    ```perl
    # Anti-pattern: Using positional parameters
    sub create_user {
        my ($name, $email, $age, $role) = @_;
        # Create user...
    }
    create_user("John", "john@example.com", 30, "admin");
    
    # Better approach: Use named parameters with a hash
    sub create_user {
        my %params = @_;
        my $name = $params{name} or die "Name is required";
        my $email = $params{email} or die "Email is required";
        my $age = $params{age} || 0;
        my $role = $params{role} || "user";
        # Create user...
    }
    create_user(
        name => "John",
        email => "john@example.com",
        age => 30,
        role => "admin"
    );
    ```
    Use named parameters (hash-based) instead of positional parameters for functions with many arguments. This makes your code more readable and allows for optional parameters.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Proper Scoping" icon="warning">
    ```perl
    # Anti-pattern: Using global variables in loops
    for $i (0..10) { # $i is global
        # Do something with $i
    }
    print "Final value: $i\n"; # $i is still accessible
    
    # Better approach: Use lexical variables with proper scoping
    for my $i (0..10) { # $i is lexically scoped to the loop
        # Do something with $i
    }
    # $i is not accessible here
    ```
    Use proper variable scoping with `my` to limit the scope of variables to where they are needed. This reduces the risk of variable name collisions and unexpected behavior.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Excessive Regular Expressions" icon="warning">
    ```perl
    # Anti-pattern: Using regular expressions for simple string operations
    my $str = "Hello, World!";
    $str =~ s/^Hello/Hi/; # Overkill for simple replacement
    
    # Better approach: Use string functions when appropriate
    my $str = "Hello, World!";
    $str =~ s/^Hello/Hi/ if index($str, "Hello") == 0;
    
    # Or even simpler
    if (substr($str, 0, 5) eq "Hello") {
        substr($str, 0, 5) = "Hi";
    }
    ```
    While Perl excels at regular expressions, they can be overkill for simple string operations. Use string functions like `index()`, `substr()`, and `split()` when appropriate.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Proper Documentation" icon="warning">
    ```perl
    # Anti-pattern: No documentation
    sub process_data {
        my ($data, $options) = @_;
        # Complex processing...
    }
    
    # Better approach: Use POD documentation
    =head2 process_data
    
    Process the given data according to the specified options.
    
    Parameters:
        $data - A hashref containing the data to process
        $options - A hashref of processing options
    
    Returns:
        A hashref containing the processed data
    
    =cut
    
    sub process_data {
        my ($data, $options) = @_;
        # Complex processing...
    }
    ```
    Document your code using Perl's Plain Old Documentation (POD) format. Good documentation helps others (and your future self) understand your code.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Excessive Magic Variables" icon="warning">
    ```perl
    # Anti-pattern: Excessive use of magic variables
    while (<>) {
        s/foo/bar/;
        print;
    }
    
    # Better approach: Use explicit variables
    while (my $line = <>) {
        $line =~ s/foo/bar/;
        print $line;
    }
    ```
    Avoid excessive use of Perl's magic variables like `$_`, `@_`, `$1`, etc. While they can make code concise, they can also make it harder to understand, especially for less experienced Perl developers.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Proper Package Organization" icon="warning">
    ```perl
    # Anti-pattern: Everything in one file
    # (hundreds of functions in a single file)
    
    # Better approach: Organize code into modules and packages
    package MyApp::User;
    
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    
    sub new { ... }
    sub authenticate { ... }
    sub get_profile { ... }
    
    1; # End of module
    ```
    Organize your code into modules and packages instead of putting everything in one file. This improves maintainability and reusability.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Bareword Filehandles" icon="warning">
    ```perl
    # Anti-pattern: Using bareword filehandles
    open(FILE, '<', "data.txt") or die "Cannot open data.txt: $!";
    while (<FILE>) {
        # Process line...
    }
    close(FILE);
    
    # Better approach: Use lexical filehandles
    open(my $file, '<', "data.txt") or die "Cannot open data.txt: $!";
    while (my $line = <$file>) {
        # Process line...
    }
    close($file);
    ```
    Avoid using bareword filehandles. Use lexical filehandles (declared with `my`) instead, which are safer and automatically closed when they go out of scope.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Proper Testing" icon="warning">
    ```perl
    # Anti-pattern: Manual testing or no testing
    
    # Better approach: Use Test::More and other testing modules
    use Test::More tests => 3;
    
    require_ok('MyModule');
    
    my $obj = MyModule->new();
    isa_ok($obj, 'MyModule');
    
    is($obj->process("input"), "expected output", "process() returns correct result");
    ```
    Write proper tests for your code using testing frameworks like `Test::More`. This helps catch bugs early and ensures your code works as expected.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Prototypes Incorrectly" icon="warning">
    ```perl
    # Anti-pattern: Misusing prototypes
    sub sum($@) { # Trying to mimic built-in functions
        my ($first, @rest) = @_;
        return $first + sum(@rest) if @rest;
        return $first;
    }
    
    # Better approach: Avoid prototypes unless you know what you're doing
    sub sum {
        my $sum = 0;
        $sum += $_ for @_;
        return $sum;
    }
    ```
    Avoid using function prototypes unless you fully understand their purpose and limitations. They don't work like function signatures in other languages and can lead to unexpected behavior.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Proper OO Techniques" icon="warning">
    ```perl
    # Anti-pattern: Ad-hoc OO
    package MyClass;
    
    sub new {
        my $class = shift;
        return bless {}, $class;
    }
    
    # Better approach: Use Moose or similar
    package MyClass;
    use Moose;
    
    has 'name' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Str');
    has 'age'  => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Int');
    
    sub greet {
        my $self = shift;
        return "Hello, " . $self->name;
    }
    
    __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;
    1;
    ```
    Use modern object-oriented frameworks like `Moose`, `Moo`, or `Object::Tiny` instead of writing your own object system from scratch. These frameworks provide features like attributes, inheritance, and type checking.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Excessive Punctuation Variables" icon="warning">
    ```perl
    # Anti-pattern: Excessive punctuation variables
    while (<>) {
        if (/^(\w+):(\d+)$/) {
            $h{$1} = $2;
        }
    }
    
    # Better approach: Use named variables
    while (my $line = <>) {
        if ($line =~ /^(\w+):(\d+)$/) {
            my $key = $1;
            my $value = $2;
            $hash{$key} = $value;
        }
    }
    ```
    Avoid excessive use of punctuation variables like `$1`, `$2`, etc. Assign them to named variables for clarity.
  </Accordion>
