  <Accordion title="Bash Anti-Patterns Overview" icon="bash">
    Bash, despite its ubiquity in system administration and automation, has several common anti-patterns that can lead to bugs, security vulnerabilities, and maintainability issues. Here are the most important anti-patterns to avoid when writing Bash scripts.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Quoting Variables" icon="warning">
    ```bash
    # Anti-pattern: Unquoted variables
    FILE_PATH=/path/with spaces/file.txt
    
    # This will fail because the spaces are treated as argument separators
    cat $FILE_PATH
    
    # Better approach: Quote your variables
    cat "$FILE_PATH"
    ```
    Always quote your variables in Bash to prevent word splitting and globbing. Unquoted variables can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when they contain spaces, wildcards, or special characters.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using ls in Scripts" icon="warning">
    ```bash
    # Anti-pattern: Parsing ls output
    for file in $(ls /path/to/directory); do
        echo "Processing $file"
        # Do something with $file
    done
    
    # Better approach: Use globbing or find
    # Option 1: Globbing
    for file in /path/to/directory/*; do
        [ -f "$file" ] || continue  # Skip if not a regular file
        echo "Processing $file"
        # Do something with $file
    done
    
    # Option 2: find with -exec
    find /path/to/directory -type f -exec echo "Processing {}" \;
    ```
    Avoid parsing the output of `ls` in scripts. It can break when filenames contain spaces, newlines, or other special characters. Use shell globbing, `find`, or other more robust methods instead.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Checking Command Exit Status" icon="warning">
    ```bash
    # Anti-pattern: Not checking command exit status
    mkdir /path/to/directory
    cd /path/to/directory
    # If mkdir fails, the script continues and cd might fail too
    
    # Better approach: Check exit status
    if ! mkdir /path/to/directory; then
        echo "Failed to create directory" >&2
        exit 1
    fi
    
    if ! cd /path/to/directory; then
        echo "Failed to change directory" >&2
        exit 1
    fi
    
    # Even better: Use set -e to exit on any error
    set -e
    mkdir /path/to/directory
    cd /path/to/directory
    # Script will automatically exit if any command fails
    ```
    Always check the exit status of commands, especially those that might fail. Use conditional statements, the `set -e` option to exit on any error, or combine both approaches for more robust error handling.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using eval" icon="warning">
    ```bash
    # Anti-pattern: Using eval with user input
    read -p "Enter command: " user_command
    eval "$user_command"  # Dangerous!
    
    # Better approach: Avoid eval or use it very carefully
    # If you must use eval, validate input strictly
    read -p "Enter command: " user_command
    if [[ "$user_command" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$ ]]; then
        eval "$user_command"
    else
        echo "Invalid command format" >&2
        exit 1
    fi
    
    # Even better: Avoid eval entirely
    read -p "Choose an option (1-3): " option
    case "$option" in
        1) echo "Option 1 selected"; command1 ;;
        2) echo "Option 2 selected"; command2 ;;
        3) echo "Option 3 selected"; command3 ;;
        *) echo "Invalid option" >&2; exit 1 ;;
    esac
    ```
    Avoid using `eval` whenever possible, especially with user input. It can lead to code injection vulnerabilities. If you must use it, validate input strictly and consider alternatives like case statements or function dispatching.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Command Injection Vulnerabilities" icon="warning">
    ```bash
    # Anti-pattern: Command injection vulnerability
    filename="$(get_filename_from_user)"
    grep "pattern" $filename  # Dangerous if filename contains shell metacharacters
    
    # Better approach: Use -- to indicate end of options
    filename="$(get_filename_from_user)"
    grep "pattern" -- "$filename"
    
    # For commands that don't support --, you can use other techniques
    # For example, with find:
    filename="$(get_filename_from_user)"
    find . -name "$filename" -type f  # Still vulnerable!
    
    # Better approach for find:
    filename="$(get_filename_from_user)"
    find . -name "$(printf %q "$filename")" -type f
    ```
    Be careful with command arguments that come from user input or external sources. Use `--` to indicate the end of options when available, and consider using `printf %q` to properly quote arguments for commands that don't support `--`.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Backticks Instead of $()" icon="warning">
    ```bash
    # Anti-pattern: Using backticks
    files=`ls -la`
    nested=`echo \`hostname\``  # Nested backticks are hard to read
    
    # Better approach: Use $() for command substitution
    files=$(ls -la)
    nested=$(echo $(hostname))  # Nested $() is much clearer
    ```
    Use `$()` for command substitution instead of backticks. It's more readable, especially when nested, and more consistent with other shell constructs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Setting IFS When Reading Lines" icon="warning">
    ```bash
    # Anti-pattern: Not setting IFS when reading lines
    while read line; do
        echo "Processing $line"
    done < file.txt
    # This will trim leading/trailing whitespace
    
    # Better approach: Set IFS to just newline
    while IFS= read -r line; do
        echo "Processing $line"
    done < file.txt
    ```
    When reading lines from a file, set `IFS=` (empty) and use the `-r` flag with `read` to prevent backslash interpretation. This preserves leading and trailing whitespace and handles backslashes correctly.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using /bin/sh for Bash Scripts" icon="warning">
    ```bash
    # Anti-pattern: Using /bin/sh for Bash-specific features
    #!/bin/sh
    
    # This might fail on systems where /bin/sh is not Bash
    array=(1 2 3)
    echo "${array[0]}"
    
    # Better approach: Use /bin/bash explicitly
    #!/bin/bash
    
    # Now Bash-specific features will work
    array=(1 2 3)
    echo "${array[0]}"
    ```
    If your script uses Bash-specific features, use `#!/bin/bash` as the shebang, not `#!/bin/sh`. On many systems, `/bin/sh` might be a different shell (like dash) that doesn't support Bash features.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using set -u" icon="warning">
    ```bash
    # Anti-pattern: Not using set -u
    echo "Home directory: $HOME"
    echo "Undefined variable: $UNDEFINED_VARIABLE"  # Expands to empty string
    
    # Better approach: Use set -u to catch undefined variables
    set -u  # or set -o nounset
    echo "Home directory: $HOME"
    echo "Undefined variable: $UNDEFINED_VARIABLE"  # Script will exit with an error
    ```
    Use `set -u` (or `set -o nounset`) to make your script exit when it tries to use an undefined variable. This helps catch typos and missing variables early.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using set -e" icon="warning">
    ```bash
    # Anti-pattern: Not using set -e
    mkdir /path/that/might/not/exist
    cd /path/that/might/not/exist
    rm -rf *  # Dangerous if previous commands failed!
    
    # Better approach: Use set -e to exit on errors
    set -e  # or set -o errexit
    mkdir /path/that/might/not/exist
    cd /path/that/might/not/exist
    rm -rf *  # Script will exit if mkdir or cd fails
    ```
    Use `set -e` (or `set -o errexit`) to make your script exit immediately if any command fails. This prevents the script from continuing in an unexpected state after an error.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Shellcheck" icon="warning">
    ```bash
    # Anti-pattern: Not using static analysis tools
    # This script has several issues that Shellcheck would catch
    for i in $(ls *.txt)
    do
      cp $i $i.bak
    done
    
    # Better approach: Use Shellcheck to find issues
    # After running shellcheck script.sh, you would fix it to:
    for i in *.txt
    do
      cp "$i" "$i.bak"
    done
    ```
    Use [Shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) to analyze your Bash scripts for common mistakes and pitfalls. It can catch many of the anti-patterns mentioned here and more.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using [ ] Instead of [[ ]]" icon="warning">
    ```bash
    # Anti-pattern: Using [ ] for complex conditions
    if [ $a == $b ] && [ $c == $d ]; then
        echo "Conditions met"
    fi
    
    # This will fail if any variable is empty
    if [ $filename == *.txt ]; then
        echo "Text file"
    fi
    
    # Better approach: Use [[ ]] for complex conditions
    if [[ $a == $b && $c == $d ]]; then
        echo "Conditions met"
    fi
    
    # This works correctly with pattern matching
    if [[ $filename == *.txt ]]; then
        echo "Text file"
    fi
    ```
    Use `[[ ]]` instead of `[ ]` for conditional tests in Bash. It's more powerful, safer with empty variables, supports logical operators directly, and provides pattern matching.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Hardcoding Paths" icon="warning">
    ```bash
    # Anti-pattern: Hardcoding paths
    cd /home/username/project
    source /home/username/project/config.sh
    
    # Better approach: Use relative paths or variables
    SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
    cd "$SCRIPT_DIR"
    source "$SCRIPT_DIR/config.sh"
    
    # Even better: Use environment variables when appropriate
    cd "${PROJECT_ROOT:-$SCRIPT_DIR}"
    source "${CONFIG_FILE:-$SCRIPT_DIR/config.sh}"
    ```
    Avoid hardcoding absolute paths in your scripts. Use relative paths, determine paths dynamically, or use environment variables to make your scripts more portable and easier to maintain.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Functions" icon="warning">
    ```bash
    # Anti-pattern: Repeated code without functions
    echo "Processing file1.txt"
    if [ -f "file1.txt" ]; then
        grep "pattern" "file1.txt"
        wc -l "file1.txt"
        # More operations...
    else
        echo "file1.txt not found" >&2
    fi
    
    echo "Processing file2.txt"
    if [ -f "file2.txt" ]; then
        grep "pattern" "file2.txt"
        wc -l "file2.txt"
        # More operations...
    else
        echo "file2.txt not found" >&2
    fi
    
    # Better approach: Use functions
    process_file() {
        local file="$1"
        echo "Processing $file"
        if [ -f "$file" ]; then
            grep "pattern" "$file"
            wc -l "$file"
            # More operations...
        else
            echo "$file not found" >&2
            return 1
        fi
    }
    
    process_file "file1.txt"
    process_file "file2.txt"
    ```
    Use functions to avoid code duplication and improve maintainability. Functions make your code more modular, easier to understand, and easier to test.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using echo for Printing to stderr" icon="warning">
    ```bash
    # Anti-pattern: Using echo for stderr
    echo "Error: something went wrong" >&2
    
    # Better approach: Use printf for consistent behavior
    printf "Error: something went wrong\n" >&2
    
    # Even better: Create an error function
    error() {
        printf "[ERROR] %s\n" "$1" >&2
    }
    
    error "Something went wrong"
    ```
    Use `printf` instead of `echo` for more consistent behavior across different systems, especially when printing to stderr or when dealing with strings that start with options like `-n` or `-e`.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Uppercase Variable Names" icon="warning">
    ```bash
    # Anti-pattern: Using uppercase for all variables
    NAME="John"
    AGE=30
    GREETING="Hello, $NAME!"
    
    # Better approach: Use lowercase for local variables
    name="John"
    age=30
    greeting="Hello, $name!"
    
    # Use uppercase only for environment variables and constants
    export DATABASE_URL="postgres://localhost:5432/mydb"
    readonly MAX_RETRIES=5
    ```
    Reserve uppercase variable names for environment variables and constants. Use lowercase for regular variables to avoid conflicts with environment variables and to follow convention.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Local Variables in Functions" icon="warning">
    ```bash
    # Anti-pattern: Not using local variables in functions
    counter=0
    
    increment_counter() {
        counter=$((counter + 1))  # Modifies global variable
    }
    
    increment_counter
    echo "Counter: $counter"  # 1
    
    # Better approach: Use local variables
    counter=0
    
    increment_counter() {
        local counter=$1
        echo $((counter + 1))
    }
    
    counter=$(increment_counter "$counter")
    echo "Counter: $counter"  # 1
    ```
    Use `local` to declare function-specific variables. This prevents unintended side effects and makes functions more self-contained and reusable.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Temporary Files Insecurely" icon="warning">
    ```bash
    # Anti-pattern: Insecure temporary files
    TEMP_FILE="/tmp/mydata.txt"
    echo "sensitive data" > "$TEMP_FILE"
    # Process the file...
    rm "$TEMP_FILE"
    
    # Better approach: Use mktemp
    TEMP_FILE=$(mktemp)
    echo "sensitive data" > "$TEMP_FILE"
    # Process the file...
    rm "$TEMP_FILE"
    
    # Even better: Clean up on exit
    TEMP_FILE=$(mktemp)
    trap "rm -f '$TEMP_FILE'" EXIT
    echo "sensitive data" > "$TEMP_FILE"
    # Process the file...
    ```
    Use `mktemp` to create secure temporary files with unique names. Add a trap to clean up temporary files when the script exits, even if it exits due to an error.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Double Brackets for Regex" icon="warning">
    ```bash
    # Anti-pattern: Using single brackets for regex
    if [ "$input" = *[0-9]* ]; then  # This is a glob, not regex
        echo "Input contains a number"
    fi
    
    # Better approach: Use double brackets with =~ for regex
    if [[ "$input" =~ [0-9] ]]; then
        echo "Input contains a number"
    fi
    ```
    Use double brackets `[[ ]]` with the `=~` operator for regular expression matching. Single brackets `[ ]` only support glob patterns, not regular expressions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Proper Shebang" icon="warning">
    ```bash
    # Anti-pattern: Missing or incorrect shebang
    echo "Hello, World!"
    
    # Better approach: Use proper shebang
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    echo "Hello, World!"
    ```
    Always include a proper shebang line at the beginning of your script. Using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` is more portable than `#!/bin/bash` because it will find the Bash interpreter in the user's PATH.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Deprecated Syntax" icon="warning">
    ```bash
    # Anti-pattern: Using deprecated syntax
    var=$[1 + 2]  # $[...] is deprecated
    
    # Better approach: Use modern syntax
    var=$((1 + 2))  # $((...)) is the modern arithmetic expansion
    ```
    Avoid using deprecated syntax like `$[...]` for arithmetic expansion. Use the modern equivalents like `$((...))` instead.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Parameter Expansion" icon="warning">
    ```bash
    # Anti-pattern: Not using parameter expansion
    if [ -z "$variable" ]; then
        variable="default"
    fi
    
    # Better approach: Use parameter expansion
    variable=${variable:-default}
    
    # More examples of useful parameter expansion
    echo "${filename%.txt}"  # Remove .txt extension
    echo "${path##*/}"      # Get basename
    echo "${path%/*}"       # Get dirname
    ```
    Use parameter expansion for default values, substring operations, and pattern matching. It's more concise and often more efficient than using conditional statements or external commands.
