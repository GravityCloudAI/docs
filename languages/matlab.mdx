  <Accordion title="MATLAB Anti-Patterns Overview" icon="matlab">
    MATLAB, despite being a powerful platform for numerical computing and data analysis, has several common anti-patterns that can lead to performance issues, maintainability problems, and bugs. Here are the most important anti-patterns to avoid when writing MATLAB code.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Growing Arrays in Loops" icon="warning">
    ```matlab
    % Anti-pattern: Growing arrays in loops
    result = [];
    for i = 1:1000
        result(i) = i^2;
    end
    
    % Better approach: Pre-allocate arrays
    result = zeros(1, 1000);
    for i = 1:1000
        result(i) = i^2;
    end
    
    % Even better: Use vectorization
    i = 1:1000;
    result = i.^2;
    ```
    Avoid growing arrays incrementally in loops. MATLAB needs to reallocate memory and copy the entire array each time it grows, which is very inefficient. Instead, pre-allocate arrays to their final size before filling them, or use vectorized operations to avoid loops entirely.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Loops Instead of Vectorization" icon="warning">
    ```matlab
    % Anti-pattern: Using loops for element-wise operations
    A = rand(1000, 1000);
    B = rand(1000, 1000);
    C = zeros(1000, 1000);
    
    for i = 1:1000
        for j = 1:1000
            C(i,j) = A(i,j) + B(i,j);
        end
    end
    
    % Better approach: Use vectorized operations
    A = rand(1000, 1000);
    B = rand(1000, 1000);
    C = A + B;
    ```
    Avoid using loops for element-wise operations on arrays. MATLAB is optimized for vectorized operations, which are much faster and more concise. Use MATLAB's built-in vectorized functions and operators whenever possible.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using eval and str2func" icon="warning">
    ```matlab
    % Anti-pattern: Using eval
    for i = 1:10
        varname = ['var' num2str(i)];
        eval([varname ' = ' num2str(i^2) ';']);
    end
    
    % Anti-pattern: Using str2func with dynamic function names
    func_name = 'sin';
    f = str2func(func_name);
    y = f(x);
    
    % Better approach: Use arrays or cell arrays
    var = zeros(1, 10);
    for i = 1:10
        var(i) = i^2;
    end
    
    % Better approach: Use function handles directly or from a container
    func_map = containers.Map({'sin', 'cos', 'tan'}, {@sin, @cos, @tan});
    func_name = 'sin';
    if isKey(func_map, func_name)
        f = func_map(func_name);
        y = f(x);
    end
    ```
    Avoid using `eval` and `str2func` with dynamically constructed strings. These functions can execute arbitrary code, making your program vulnerable to code injection if the strings come from external sources. They also make code harder to debug and maintain. Use arrays, cell arrays, or containers.Map to store multiple values or function handles instead.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Global Variables" icon="warning">
    ```matlab
    % Anti-pattern: Using global variables
    global data config;
    
    function processData()
        global data;
        % Process data
    end
    
    function saveResults()
        global data config;
        % Save results using data and config
    end
    
    % Better approach: Pass variables as parameters
    function data = processData(data)
        % Process data
    end
    
    function saveResults(data, config)
        % Save results using data and config
    end
    
    % Usage
    data = loadData();
    config = loadConfig();
    data = processData(data);
    saveResults(data, config);
    ```
    Avoid using global variables. They create hidden dependencies between functions, make code harder to understand and test, and can lead to unexpected behavior. Instead, pass variables explicitly as function parameters and return values.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Functions for Code Organization" icon="warning">
    ```matlab
    % Anti-pattern: Long scripts without functions
    % Script.m
    % Load data
    data = load('data.mat');
    
    % Process data
    % ... many lines of processing code ...
    
    % Plot results
    % ... many lines of plotting code ...
    
    % Save results
    % ... many lines of saving code ...
    
    % Better approach: Organize code into functions
    % Main script
    function main()
        data = loadData('data.mat');
        processedData = processData(data);
        plotResults(processedData);
        saveResults(processedData, 'results.mat');
    end
    
    function data = loadData(filename)
        data = load(filename);
    end
    
    function processedData = processData(data)
        % Process data
        processedData = ...
    end
    
    function plotResults(data)
        % Plot results
    end
    
    function saveResults(data, filename)
        % Save results
        save(filename, 'data');
    end
    ```
    Avoid writing long scripts without breaking them into functions. This makes code harder to understand, test, and reuse. Instead, organize your code into functions with clear responsibilities, and use a main script or function to coordinate their execution.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using clear all/close all/clc" icon="warning">
    ```matlab
    % Anti-pattern: Using clear all/close all/clc in scripts
    clear all;
    close all;
    clc;
    
    % Load and process data
    % ...
    
    % Better approach: Be specific about what to clear
    % Only clear variables you need to clear
    clear x y z;
    
    % Only close figures you need to close
    close(figHandle);
    ```
    Avoid using `clear all`, `close all`, and `clc` in scripts and functions, especially those that might be called by other scripts or functions. These commands affect the entire MATLAB environment, not just your script's scope, which can lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging more difficult. Instead, be specific about what variables to clear and what figures to close.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Handling Errors Properly" icon="warning">
    ```matlab
    % Anti-pattern: Not handling errors
    fileID = fopen('data.txt', 'r');
    data = fscanf(fileID, '%f');
    fclose(fileID);
    % If file doesn't exist, this will crash without a helpful message
    
    % Better approach: Use try-catch for error handling
    try
        fileID = fopen('data.txt', 'r');
        if fileID == -1
            error('Could not open file data.txt');
        end
        data = fscanf(fileID, '%f');
        fclose(fileID);
    catch ME
        disp(['Error: ' ME.message]);
        % Handle the error appropriately
        if exist('fileID', 'var') && fileID ~= -1
            fclose(fileID);
        end
    end
    ```
    Always handle errors properly in your code. Use try-catch blocks to catch and handle exceptions, check return values from functions that might fail, and provide meaningful error messages. This makes your code more robust and easier to debug.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using i and j as Variable Names" icon="warning">
    ```matlab
    % Anti-pattern: Using i and j as variable names
    for i = 1:10
        for j = 1:10
            % Using i and j as loop indices
        end
    end
    
    % Later in the code
    z = x + i*y;  % Oops! i might not be the imaginary unit anymore
    
    % Better approach: Use different variable names for indices
    for ii = 1:10
        for jj = 1:10
            % Using ii and jj as loop indices
        end
    end
    
    % Now i and j still refer to the imaginary unit
    z = x + 1i*y;  % Even better: use 1i instead of i
    ```
    Avoid using `i` and `j` as variable names, especially for loop indices. In MATLAB, `i` and `j` are predefined as the imaginary unit (√-1), and overwriting them can lead to unexpected behavior in complex arithmetic. Use `ii`, `jj`, or other names for loop indices, and consider using `1i` instead of `i` for the imaginary unit.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Magic Numbers" icon="warning">
    ```matlab
    % Anti-pattern: Using magic numbers
    % Calculate area of a circle
    area = 3.14159 * radius^2;
    
    % Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit
    tempF = tempC * 1.8 + 32;
    
    % Better approach: Define constants
    PI = 3.14159;  % Even better: use pi
    area = PI * radius^2;
    
    % Better: use pi
    area = pi * radius^2;
    
    % Define conversion factors
    C_TO_F_SCALE = 1.8;
    C_TO_F_OFFSET = 32;
    tempF = tempC * C_TO_F_SCALE + C_TO_F_OFFSET;
    ```
    Avoid using magic numbers (hardcoded numeric literals) in your code. Instead, define constants with meaningful names at the beginning of your script or function. This makes your code more readable, maintainable, and less prone to errors. For mathematical constants like π, use MATLAB's built-in constants (e.g., `pi`).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Ignoring Code Vectorization Opportunities" icon="warning">
    ```matlab
    % Anti-pattern: Missing vectorization opportunities
    result = zeros(length(x), 1);
    for i = 1:length(x)
        if x(i) > 0
            result(i) = sqrt(x(i));
        else
            result(i) = 0;
        end
    end
    
    % Better approach: Use logical indexing and vectorization
    result = zeros(size(x));
    positive = x > 0;
    result(positive) = sqrt(x(positive));
    ```
    Don't miss opportunities for vectorization. MATLAB provides many ways to avoid loops, such as logical indexing, vectorized functions, and array operations. Look for patterns in your code where you're performing the same operation on many elements, and try to vectorize them.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Logical Indexing" icon="warning">
    ```matlab
    % Anti-pattern: Using loops for filtering
    data = rand(1000, 1);
    filtered = zeros(1000, 1);
    count = 0;
    
    for i = 1:length(data)
        if data(i) > 0.5
            count = count + 1;
            filtered(count) = data(i);
        end
    end
    
    filtered = filtered(1:count);
    
    % Better approach: Use logical indexing
    data = rand(1000, 1);
    filtered = data(data > 0.5);
    ```
    Use logical indexing to filter arrays instead of loops. Logical indexing is a powerful MATLAB feature that allows you to select elements based on conditions. It's much faster and more concise than using loops.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Inefficient File I/O" icon="warning">
    ```matlab
    % Anti-pattern: Reading a file line by line
    fileID = fopen('data.txt', 'r');
    data = {};
    i = 1;
    
    while ~feof(fileID)
        line = fgetl(fileID);
        data{i} = line;
        i = i + 1;
    end
    
    fclose(fileID);
    
    % Better approach: Read the entire file at once
    fileID = fopen('data.txt', 'r');
    data = textscan(fileID, '%s', 'Delimiter', '\n');
    fclose(fileID);
    data = data{1};
    
    % Or even simpler
    data = readlines('data.txt');  % In newer MATLAB versions
    ```
    Avoid inefficient file I/O operations, such as reading a file line by line in a loop. Instead, use functions like `textscan`, `readtable`, `readmatrix`, or `readlines` (in newer versions) to read the entire file at once. These functions are optimized for performance and make your code more concise.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Built-in Functions" icon="warning">
    ```matlab
    % Anti-pattern: Reimplementing built-in functionality
    % Calculate mean manually
    sum_val = 0;
    for i = 1:length(data)
        sum_val = sum_val + data(i);
    end
    mean_val = sum_val / length(data);
    
    % Find maximum value manually
    max_val = data(1);
    for i = 2:length(data)
        if data(i) > max_val
            max_val = data(i);
        end
    end
    
    % Better approach: Use built-in functions
    mean_val = mean(data);
    max_val = max(data);
    ```
    Don't reinvent the wheel by implementing functionality that already exists in MATLAB. MATLAB provides a vast library of built-in functions that are optimized for performance. Familiarize yourself with common functions for statistics, linear algebra, signal processing, and other domains relevant to your work.

  <Accordion title="Using Nested Loops for Matrix Operations" icon="warning">
    ```matlab
    % Anti-pattern: Using nested loops for matrix operations
    A = rand(100, 100);
    B = rand(100, 100);
    C = zeros(100, 100);
    
    for i = 1:100
        for j = 1:100

            end
        end
    end
    
    % Better approach: Use built-in matrix operations
    A = rand(100, 100);
    B = rand(100, 100);
    C = A * B;
    ```
    Avoid using nested loops for matrix operations like multiplication, transposition, or inversion. MATLAB's built-in matrix operations are highly optimized and much faster. Use operators like `*`, `'`, and functions like `inv` instead of implementing these operations manually.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Appropriate Data Structures" icon="warning">
    ```matlab
    % Anti-pattern: Using arrays for heterogeneous data
    names = {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'};
    ages = [25, 30, 35];
    scores = [95, 85, 90];
    
    % Accessing data for a specific person is cumbersome
    person_idx = find(strcmp(names, 'Bob'));
    bob_age = ages(person_idx);
    bob_score = scores(person_idx);
    
    % Better approach: Use structures or tables
    % Option 1: Structure array
    people(1).name = 'Alice';
    people(1).age = 25;
    people(1).score = 95;
    
    people(2).name = 'Bob';
    people(2).age = 30;
    people(2).score = 85;
    
    people(3).name = 'Charlie';
    people(3).age = 35;
    people(3).score = 90;
    
    % Accessing data for a specific person
    bob_idx = find(strcmp({people.name}, 'Bob'));
    bob = people(bob_idx);
    
    % Option 2: Table (in newer MATLAB versions)
    people = table(names', ages', scores', 'VariableNames', {'Name', 'Age', 'Score'});
    
    % Accessing data for a specific person
    bob = people(strcmp(people.Name, 'Bob'), :);
    ```
    Use appropriate data structures for your data. For heterogeneous data with named fields, use structures or tables instead of parallel arrays. For large, homogeneous numerical data, use arrays. For sparse matrices, use sparse arrays. Choosing the right data structure can make your code more readable and efficient.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Cell Arrays Appropriately" icon="warning">
    ```matlab
    % Anti-pattern: Using cell arrays inappropriately
    % Storing numeric data in cell arrays
    data = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    sum_val = 0;
    for i = 1:length(data)
        sum_val = sum_val + data{i};
    end
    
    % Better approach: Use numeric arrays for numeric data
    data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    sum_val = sum(data);
    
    % Anti-pattern: Not using cell arrays when appropriate
    % Storing strings of different lengths
    names = ['Alice   '; 'Bob     '; 'Charlie '];
    
    % Better approach: Use cell arrays for strings
    names = {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'};
    ```
    Use cell arrays appropriately. Cell arrays are useful for storing heterogeneous data or data of varying sizes, like strings of different lengths. However, they're less efficient than regular arrays for homogeneous numeric data. Use regular arrays for numeric data and cell arrays for mixed data types or varying-size data.

  <Accordion title="Not Using Function Handles" icon="warning">
    ```matlab
    % Anti-pattern: Not using function handles

    % Usage
    area1 = integrate(@sin, 0, pi, 1000);
    area2 = integrate(@cos, 0, pi, 1000);
    area3 = integrate(@exp, 0, 1, 1000);
    
    % Even better: Use built-in integration functions
    area1 = integral(@sin, 0, pi);
    ```
    Use function handles to pass functions as arguments to other functions. This is more flexible and efficient than passing function names as strings and using conditional statements. Function handles also enable you to use anonymous functions for simple operations.

    ```
    Use appropriate comments and documentation in your code. Comments should explain why the code does something, not what it does (which should be clear from the code itself). Use MATLAB's help comment format for functions to provide documentation that can be accessed with the `help` command.

  <Accordion title="Not Using Meaningful Variable Names" icon="warning">
    ```matlab
    % Anti-pattern: Using cryptic variable names
    function r = c(a, b)
