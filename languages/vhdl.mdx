  <Accordion title="VHDL Anti-Patterns Overview" icon="vhdl">
    VHDL, as a hardware description language, has several common anti-patterns that can lead to simulation-synthesis mismatches, timing issues, and hard-to-debug hardware designs. Here are the most important anti-patterns to avoid when writing VHDL code.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Variables Instead of Signals" icon="warning">
    ```vhdl
    -- Anti-pattern: Using variables in sequential processes
    architecture bad of counter is
      signal count : integer range 0 to 15;
    begin
      process(clk, reset)
        variable temp : integer range 0 to 15;
      begin
        if reset = '1' then
          temp := 0;
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
          temp := temp + 1;
          if temp = 15 then
            temp := 0;
          end if;
        end if;
        count <= temp; -- Assigning variable to signal
      end process;
    end architecture;
    
    -- Better approach: Use signals for sequential logic
    architecture good of counter is
      signal count : integer range 0 to 15;
    begin
      process(clk, reset)
      begin
        if reset = '1' then
          count <= 0;
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
          if count = 14 then
            count <= 0;
          else
            count <= count + 1;
          end if;
        end if;
      end process;
    end architecture;
    ```
    Avoid using variables for sequential logic. Variables update immediately when assigned, which can lead to unexpected behavior and simulation-synthesis mismatches. Use signals for sequential logic, as they update at the end of the process, modeling hardware behavior more accurately.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Multiple Signal Assignments" icon="warning">
    ```vhdl
    -- Anti-pattern: Multiple assignments to the same signal
    architecture bad of mux is
      signal output : std_logic;
    begin
      process(sel, a, b)
      begin
        if sel = '0' then
          output <= a;
        end if;
        
        if sel = '1' then
          output <= b;
        end if;
      end process;
    end architecture;
    
    -- Better approach: Single assignment with conditional logic
    architecture good of mux is
      signal output : std_logic;
    begin
      process(sel, a, b)
      begin
        if sel = '0' then
          output <= a;
        else
          output <= b;
        end if;
      end process;
    end architecture;
    ```
    Avoid multiple assignments to the same signal within a process. This can lead to race conditions and simulation-synthesis mismatches. Use a single assignment with conditional logic to ensure deterministic behavior.

  <Accordion title="Incomplete Sensitivity Lists" icon="warning">
    ```vhdl
    -- Anti-pattern: Incomplete sensitivity list
    architecture bad of alu is

          when others => result <= (others => '0');

    -- Better approach: Complete sensitivity list

          when others => result <= (others => '0');
        end case;
      end process;
    end architecture;
    
    -- Even better: Use VHDL-2008 process(all) for automatic sensitivity list
    architecture best of alu is
      signal result : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
    begin
      process(all) -- Automatic sensitivity list (VHDL-2008)
      begin
        case op is
          when "00" => result <= a + b;
          when "01" => result <= a - b;
          when "10" => result <= a and b;
          when "11" => result <= a or b;
          when others => result <= (others => '0');
        end case;
      end process;
    end architecture;
    ```
    Always use complete sensitivity lists for combinational processes. Incomplete sensitivity lists can lead to simulation-synthesis mismatches and incorrect behavior. In VHDL-2008, you can use `process(all)` for an automatic sensitivity list.

    ```
    Always provide default assignments to all signals at the beginning of combinational processes. Incomplete assignments can create unintended latches in your design, leading to unexpected behavior and timing issues.

  <Accordion title="Mixing Blocking and Non-Blocking Assignments" icon="warning">
    ```vhdl
    -- Anti-pattern: Mixing signal and variable assignments
    architecture bad of mixed_assignments is

      end process;
    end architecture;
    ```
    Avoid mixing signal assignments (non-blocking, using `<=`) and variable assignments (blocking, using `:=`) within the same process. This can lead to confusion and potential simulation-synthesis mismatches. Use signals consistently for sequential logic.

  <Accordion title="Asynchronous Reset Release" icon="warning">
    ```vhdl
    -- Anti-pattern: Asynchronous reset release

        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
          if reset_sync2 = '0' then
            count <= count + 1;
          end if;
        end if;
      end process;
    end architecture;
    ```
    Synchronize asynchronous reset release to avoid metastability issues. While asynchronous reset assertion is often used for reliable system initialization, the release should be synchronized to the clock to prevent timing violations.

  <Accordion title="Combinational Loops" icon="warning">
    ```vhdl

    architecture bad of comb_loop is

      b <= input;
      c <= a or d;

    Avoid creating combinational loops in your design. Combinational loops can lead to oscillations, unstable behavior, and synthesis issues. Break loops using registers or redesign your logic.

    Avoid using `wait` statements in synthesizable code. `wait` statements are generally not synthesizable (except for some specific forms like `wait until rising_edge(clk)` in some tools). Use process sensitivity lists and additional registers to implement delays.

    Avoid using unprotected shared variables, as they can lead to race conditions and undefined behavior. Use protected types (available in VHDL-2002 and later) to ensure thread-safe access to shared variables.

    Avoid using inferred latches for memory. Instead, use a clocked process for writes and a separate combinational process for reads. This ensures that your memory is implemented using proper memory resources (like block RAM) rather than latches.

    Use generics to parameterize your designs. This makes your code more reusable and configurable. Generics can be used to specify bit widths, constants, and other parameters that might need to be changed when reusing the design.

    Use named association in port maps and generic maps. Named association is clearer, less error-prone, and allows for port reordering without breaking your design.
