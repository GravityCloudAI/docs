  <Accordion title="Haskell Anti-Patterns Overview" icon="haskell">
    Haskell, despite being a powerful and elegant functional language, has several common anti-patterns that can lead to performance issues, maintainability problems, and bugs. Here are the most important anti-patterns to avoid when writing Haskell code.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="String Concatenation with ++" icon="warning">
    ```haskell
    -- Anti-pattern: String concatenation with ++
    buildMessage :: [String] -> String
    buildMessage [] = ""
    buildMessage (x:xs) = x ++ " " ++ buildMessage xs  -- O(n²) complexity
    
    -- Better approach: Use a more efficient data structure
    import Data.Text (Text)
    import qualified Data.Text as T
    
    buildMessage :: [Text] -> Text
    buildMessage = T.intercalate (T.pack " ")
    
    -- Or with String but using ShowS for efficiency
    buildMessageS :: [String] -> String
    buildMessageS xs = foldr (\x acc -> x ++ " " ++ acc) "" xs
    ```
    Avoid using `++` for repeated string concatenation, as it has O(n²) complexity. Use more efficient data structures like `Text` or `ByteString`, or techniques like `ShowS` or `Builder`.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Partial Functions" icon="warning">
    ```haskell
    -- Anti-pattern: Partial functions
    headOfList :: [a] -> a
    headOfList xs = head xs  -- Crashes on empty list
    
    lookupValue :: Eq k => k -> [(k, v)] -> v
    lookupValue k xs = fromJust (lookup k xs)  -- Crashes if key not found
    
    -- Better approach: Return Maybe or Either
    headOfList :: [a] -> Maybe a
    headOfList [] = Nothing
    headOfList (x:_) = Just x
    
    lookupValue :: Eq k => k -> [(k, v)] -> Maybe v
    lookupValue k xs = lookup k xs
    ```
    Avoid partial functions like `head`, `tail`, `fromJust`, etc. that can crash on certain inputs. Instead, use pattern matching or return `Maybe` or `Either` to handle all possible cases.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Inefficient List Processing" icon="warning">
    ```haskell
    -- Anti-pattern: Inefficient list processing
    sumOfSquares :: [Int] -> Int
    sumOfSquares xs = sum [x * x | x <- xs, x > 0]  -- Creates intermediate list
    
    -- Better approach: Use foldr/foldl'
    sumOfSquares :: [Int] -> Int
    sumOfSquares = foldl' (\acc x -> if x > 0 then acc + x * x else acc) 0
    ```
    Avoid creating intermediate lists when processing data. Use higher-order functions like `foldr`, `foldl'`, or `foldMap` for more efficient processing.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Strictness Annotations" icon="warning">
    ```haskell
    -- Anti-pattern: Not using strictness annotations
    data Point = Point Double Double  -- Lazy fields
    
    sumPoints :: [Point] -> Point
    sumPoints points = foldl addPoints (Point 0 0) points
      where addPoints (Point x1 y1) (Point x2 y2) = Point (x1 + x2) (y1 + y2)
    
    -- Better approach: Use strictness annotations
    data Point = Point !Double !Double  -- Strict fields
    
    sumPoints :: [Point] -> Point
    sumPoints = foldl' addPoints (Point 0 0)
      where addPoints (Point x1 y1) (Point x2 y2) = Point (x1 + x2) (y1 + y2)
    ```
    Use strictness annotations (`!`) for data fields that should be evaluated eagerly, especially in numeric computations, to avoid space leaks and improve performance.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using String Instead of Text or ByteString" icon="warning">
    ```haskell
    -- Anti-pattern: Using String for text processing
    countLines :: String -> Int
    countLines = length . lines
    
    -- Better approach: Use Text or ByteString
    import qualified Data.Text as T
    import qualified Data.Text.IO as TIO
    
    countLines :: T.Text -> Int
    countLines = length . T.lines
    
    main :: IO ()
    main = do
      content <- TIO.readFile "file.txt"
      print $ countLines content
    ```
    Avoid using `String` (which is a linked list of characters) for text processing. Use `Text` or `ByteString` for better performance with large text data.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Newtypes" icon="warning">
    ```haskell
    -- Anti-pattern: Using type synonyms
    type UserId = Int
    type Username = String
    
    lookupUser :: UserId -> IO (Maybe Username)
    lookupUser uid = -- implementation
    
    -- Prone to errors like this:
    someFunction :: Username -> UserId -> IO ()
    someFunction uid name = lookupUser name >>= -- Wrong order, but compiles!
    
    -- Better approach: Use newtypes
    newtype UserId = UserId Int deriving (Eq, Show)
    newtype Username = Username String deriving (Eq, Show)
    
    lookupUser :: UserId -> IO (Maybe Username)
    lookupUser (UserId uid) = -- implementation
    
    -- Now this won't compile:
    someFunction :: Username -> UserId -> IO ()
    someFunction name uid = lookupUser name -- Type error!
    ```
    Use `newtype` instead of `type` for type aliases to get compile-time type checking and avoid mixing up values of the same underlying type but different semantic meanings.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Excessive Use of Point-Free Style" icon="warning">
    ```haskell
    -- Anti-pattern: Excessive point-free style
    processData :: [Int] -> [Int]
    processData = map (*2) . filter (>0) . takeWhile (<100) . dropWhile (==0)
    
    -- Better approach: More readable style
    processData :: [Int] -> [Int]
    processData xs = map (*2) $ filter (>0) $ takeWhile (<100) $ dropWhile (==0) xs
    
    -- Or even clearer with named steps
    processData :: [Int] -> [Int]
    processData xs = map (*2) validNumbers
      where 
        withoutLeadingZeros = dropWhile (==0) xs
        numbersUnder100 = takeWhile (<100) withoutLeadingZeros
        validNumbers = filter (>0) numbersUnder100
    ```
    Avoid excessive point-free style that makes code hard to read. Use named parameters and intermediate values when it improves clarity.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Record Syntax" icon="warning">
    ```haskell
    -- Anti-pattern: Not using record syntax
    data Person = Person String Int String
    
    getName :: Person -> String
    getName (Person name _ _) = name
    
    getAge :: Person -> Int
    getAge (Person _ age _) = age
    
    getEmail :: Person -> String
    getEmail (Person _ _ email) = email
    
    -- Better approach: Use record syntax
    data Person = Person 
      { name :: String
      , age :: Int
      , email :: String
      }
    
    -- Now we get accessor functions for free
    -- And can create/update records more clearly
    updateEmail :: String -> Person -> Person
    updateEmail newEmail person = person { email = newEmail }
    ```
    Use record syntax for data types with multiple fields to get accessor functions for free and make field access more explicit and maintainable.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Language Extensions Appropriately" icon="warning">
    ```haskell
    -- Anti-pattern: Not using helpful language extensions
    data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
    
    instance Functor Maybe where
      fmap _ Nothing = Nothing
      fmap f (Just a) = Just (f a)
    
    instance Applicative Maybe where
      pure = Just
      Nothing <*> _ = Nothing
      (Just f) <*> x = fmap f x
    
    instance Monad Maybe where
      return = pure
      Nothing >>= _ = Nothing
      (Just a) >>= f = f a
    
    -- Better approach: Use language extensions
    {-# LANGUAGE DeriveFunctor, DeriveFoldable, DeriveTraversable #-}
    
    data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
      deriving (Functor, Foldable, Traversable)
    
    -- Or even better with more extensions
    {-# LANGUAGE DerivingStrategies, GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-}
    
    newtype UserId = UserId Int
      deriving stock (Eq, Ord, Show)
      deriving newtype (Num, Enum)
    ```
    Use appropriate language extensions like `DeriveFunctor`, `RecordWildCards`, or `OverloadedStrings` to make your code more concise and expressive.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Smart Constructors" icon="warning">
    ```haskell
    -- Anti-pattern: Exposing constructors for invalid states
    module Email (Email(..)) where
    
    data Email = Email String
    
    -- Client code can create invalid emails
    invalidEmail = Email "not-an-email"
    
    -- Better approach: Use smart constructors
    module Email (Email, mkEmail, emailAddress) where
    
    data Email = Email String
    
    emailAddress :: Email -> String
    emailAddress (Email addr) = addr
    
    mkEmail :: String -> Maybe Email
    mkEmail addr
      | isValidEmail addr = Just (Email addr)
      | otherwise = Nothing
    
    isValidEmail :: String -> Bool
    isValidEmail = -- validation logic
    ```
    Use smart constructors to ensure that invalid states cannot be represented. Hide data constructors and expose only functions that create valid values.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using IO Unnecessarily" icon="warning">
    ```haskell
    -- Anti-pattern: Using IO unnecessarily
    calculateTotal :: [Double] -> IO Double
    calculateTotal prices = do
      let subtotal = sum prices
      let tax = subtotal * 0.1
      let total = subtotal + tax
      return total  -- No IO needed here
    
    -- Better approach: Pure function
    calculateTotal :: [Double] -> Double
    calculateTotal prices = subtotal + tax
      where
        subtotal = sum prices
        tax = subtotal * 0.1
    ```
    Keep functions pure (without IO) whenever possible. Only use the IO monad when you actually need to perform input/output operations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Appropriate Monads" icon="warning">
    ```haskell
    -- Anti-pattern: Explicit error handling everywhere
    processItem :: Item -> Either Error Result
    
    processItems :: [Item] -> Either Error [Result]
    processItems [] = Right []
    processItems (x:xs) = case processItem x of
      Left err -> Left err
      Right result -> case processItems xs of
        Left err -> Left err
        Right results -> Right (result : results)
    
    -- Better approach: Use appropriate monads
    import Control.Monad.Except
    
    processItem :: Item -> Either Error Result
    
    processItems :: [Item] -> Either Error [Result]
    processItems items = forM items processItem
    
    -- Or with different monads for different concerns
    import Control.Monad.Reader
    import Control.Monad.Except
    
    processItem :: ReaderT Config (ExceptT Error IO) Result
    ```
    Use appropriate monads and monad transformers for different concerns like error handling (`Either`, `ExceptT`), configuration (`Reader`), or state (`State`).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Lenses for Deep Updates" icon="warning">
    ```haskell
    -- Anti-pattern: Manual nested record updates
    data Address = Address { street :: String, city :: String, zipCode :: String }
    data Person = Person { name :: String, age :: Int, address :: Address }
    
    updateZipCode :: String -> Person -> Person
    updateZipCode newZip person =
      person { address = (address person) { zipCode = newZip } }
    
    -- Better approach: Use lenses
    {-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}
    import Control.Lens
    
    data Address = Address { _street :: String, _city :: String, _zipCode :: String }
    data Person = Person { _name :: String, _age :: Int, _address :: Address }
    
    makeLenses ''Address
    makeLenses ''Person
    
    updateZipCode :: String -> Person -> Person
    updateZipCode newZip = address.zipCode .~ newZip
    ```
    Use lenses (e.g., from the `lens` package) for working with nested data structures, especially when you need to update deeply nested fields.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Type Classes Appropriately" icon="warning">
    ```haskell
    -- Anti-pattern: Duplicated functionality
    serializeToJSON :: User -> String
    serializeToJSON user = -- implementation
    
    serializeToJSON :: Product -> String
    serializeToJSON product = -- implementation
    
    -- Better approach: Use type classes
    class ToJSON a where
      toJSON :: a -> String
    
    instance ToJSON User where
      toJSON user = -- implementation
    
    instance ToJSON Product where
      toJSON product = -- implementation
    
    -- Now we can write generic functions
    saveToFile :: ToJSON a => FilePath -> a -> IO ()
    saveToFile path obj = writeFile path (toJSON obj)
    ```
    Use type classes to define common interfaces for different types, enabling polymorphic functions and reducing code duplication.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Proper Error Messages" icon="warning">
    ```haskell
    -- Anti-pattern: Poor error messages
    parseConfig :: String -> Config
    parseConfig str = case decode str of
      Nothing -> error "Parse failed"  -- Unhelpful message
      Just config -> config
    
    -- Better approach: Descriptive errors
    parseConfig :: String -> Either String Config
    parseConfig str = case decode str of
      Nothing -> Left $ "Failed to parse config: " ++ str
      Just config -> Right config
    
    -- Even better with custom error types
    data ConfigError = InvalidFormat String | MissingField String | InvalidValue String String
      deriving Show
    
    parseConfig :: String -> Either ConfigError Config
    ```
    Provide descriptive error messages and use structured error types. Avoid using `error` or `undefined` in production code.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Lazy I/O" icon="warning">
    ```haskell
    -- Anti-pattern: Lazy I/O
    processFile :: FilePath -> IO ()
    processFile path = do
      contents <- readFile path  -- Lazy I/O
      let lines = lines contents
      -- Process lines
      -- File might still be open here!
    
    -- Better approach: Strict I/O or streaming
    import qualified Data.ByteString as BS
    
    processFile :: FilePath -> IO ()
    processFile path = do
      contents <- BS.readFile path  -- Strict I/O
      let lines = BS.split 10 contents  -- Split on newline
      -- Process lines
      -- File is definitely closed here
    
    -- Or using streaming libraries
    import Streaming.Prelude as S
    import qualified Streaming.ByteString as SB
    
    processFile :: FilePath -> IO ()
    processFile path = SB.readFile path
      & SB.lines
      & S.map processLine
      & S.stdoutLn
    ```
    Avoid lazy I/O which can lead to resource leaks and unpredictable performance. Use strict I/O or streaming libraries instead.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Proper Project Structure" icon="warning">
    ```haskell
    -- Anti-pattern: Everything in one file
    -- Main.hs with thousands of lines
    
    -- Better approach: Modular project structure
    -- src/
    --   MyApp/
    --     Types.hs
    --     Database.hs
    --     API.hs
    --     Utils.hs
    --   Main.hs
    ```
    Organize your code into modules with clear responsibilities. Follow a consistent project structure to make your codebase more maintainable.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Proper Dependency Management" icon="warning">
    ```haskell
    -- Anti-pattern: Manual dependency management
    -- Copying code from other projects
    -- Using globally installed packages
    
    -- Better approach: Use Cabal or Stack
    -- package.yaml (for Stack)
    name: my-project
    version: 0.1.0.0
    dependencies:
      - base >= 4.7 && < 5
      - text
      - aeson
      - containers
    library:
      source-dirs: src
    executables:
      my-project-exe:
        main: Main.hs
        source-dirs: app
        dependencies:
          - my-project
    tests:
      my-project-test:
        main: Spec.hs
        source-dirs: test
        dependencies:
          - my-project
          - hspec
    ```
    Use proper dependency management tools like Cabal or Stack to manage your project's dependencies and build process.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Proper Testing" icon="warning">
    ```haskell
    -- Anti-pattern: Manual testing or no testing
    main = do
      let result = myFunction 42
      print result  -- Manual check
    
    -- Better approach: Use testing frameworks
    import Test.Hspec
    import Test.QuickCheck
    
    main :: IO ()
    main = hspec $ do
      describe "myFunction" $ do
        it "returns correct result for specific input" $ do
          myFunction 42 `shouldBe` expectedResult
        
        it "satisfies key property" $ property $
          \x -> myFunction x >= 0  -- Property-based test
    ```
    Write proper tests using frameworks like HUnit, Hspec, or QuickCheck. Use property-based testing when appropriate.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Proper Documentation" icon="warning">
    ```haskell
    -- Anti-pattern: Poor or no documentation
    processData :: [a] -> [a]
    processData xs = -- implementation
    
    -- Better approach: Proper documentation
    -- | Process a list of items according to business rules.
    -- The function filters out invalid items and transforms the rest.
    --
    -- >>> processData [1, 2, 3, 4]
    -- [2, 4, 6, 8]
    --
    -- >>> processData []
    -- []
    processData :: [a] -> [a]
    processData xs = -- implementation
    ```
    Document your code with Haddock comments. Include descriptions, examples, and edge cases to help users understand how to use your functions.
