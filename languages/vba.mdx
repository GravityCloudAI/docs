  <Accordion title="VBA Anti-Patterns Overview" icon="vba">
    Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), despite being a powerful tool for Microsoft Office automation, has several common anti-patterns that can lead to maintainability problems, performance issues, and bugs. Here are the most important anti-patterns to avoid when writing VBA code.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Select/Activate in Excel VBA" icon="warning">
    ```vba
    ' Anti-pattern: Using Select/Activate
    Sub FormatCells()
        Sheets("Sheet1").Select
        Range("A1:D10").Select
        Selection.Font.Bold = True
        Selection.Interior.Color = RGB(255, 255, 0)
    End Sub
    
    ' Better approach: Direct object references
    Sub FormatCells()
        With Sheets("Sheet1").Range("A1:D10")
            .Font.Bold = True
            .Interior.Color = RGB(255, 255, 0)
        End With
    End Sub
    ```
    Avoid using Select and Activate methods in Excel VBA. These methods are slow, can be affected by user selection, and make code harder to maintain. Instead, use direct object references to manipulate ranges and other objects.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Global Variables Excessively" icon="warning">
    ```vba
    ' Anti-pattern: Excessive use of global variables
    Public gUserName As String
    Public gLastUpdated As Date
    Public gDataArray() As Variant
    
    Sub ProcessData()
        ' Using global variables
        gUserName = "John"
        gLastUpdated = Now
        ReDim gDataArray(1 To 100)
        ' Process data...
    End Sub
    
    Sub DisplayResults()
        ' Using global variables
        MsgBox "Data processed by " & gUserName & " at " & gLastUpdated
        ' Display results...
    End Sub
    
    ' Better approach: Pass parameters between procedures
    Sub ProcessData()
        Dim userName As String
        Dim lastUpdated As Date
        Dim dataArray() As Variant
        
        userName = "John"
        lastUpdated = Now
        ReDim dataArray(1 To 100)
        ' Process data...
        
        DisplayResults userName, lastUpdated, dataArray
    End Sub
    
    Sub DisplayResults(userName As String, lastUpdated As Date, dataArray() As Variant)
        MsgBox "Data processed by " & userName & " at " & lastUpdated
        ' Display results...
    End Sub
    ```
    Avoid excessive use of global variables. They create hidden dependencies between procedures, make code harder to test and maintain, and can lead to unexpected behavior. Instead, pass parameters between procedures and use local variables when possible.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Option Explicit" icon="warning">
    ```vba
    ' Anti-pattern: Not using Option Explicit
    Sub CalculateTotal()
        counter = 1  ' Implicitly declared variable
        totel = 0    ' Misspelled variable name, creates a new variable
        
        Do While counter <= 10
            totel = totel + counter  ' Using the wrong variable
            counter = counter + 1
        Loop
        
        MsgBox "The total is: " & total  ' Refers to a third variable, which is empty
    End Sub
    
    ' Better approach: Use Option Explicit
    Option Explicit
    
    Sub CalculateTotal()
        Dim counter As Integer
        Dim total As Integer
        
        counter = 1
        total = 0
        
        Do While counter <= 10
            total = total + counter
            counter = counter + 1
        Loop
        
        MsgBox "The total is: " & total
    End Sub
    ```
    Always use `Option Explicit` at the top of your modules to force explicit variable declaration. This prevents typos in variable names from creating new variables, which can lead to hard-to-find bugs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using On Error Resume Next Without Proper Error Handling" icon="warning">
    ```vba
    ' Anti-pattern: Using On Error Resume Next without proper handling
    Sub ProcessFiles()
        On Error Resume Next
        ' Code that might cause errors
        Kill "C:\Temp\*.tmp"
        MkDir "C:\NewFolder"
        ' Continuing without checking if errors occurred
    End Sub
    
    ' Better approach: Proper error handling
    Sub ProcessFiles()
        On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
        
        Kill "C:\Temp\*.tmp"
        MkDir "C:\NewFolder"
        
        Exit Sub
        
    ErrorHandler:
        Select Case Err.Number
            Case 53  ' File not found
                MsgBox "No temporary files to delete.", vbInformation
                Resume Next
            Case 75  ' Path/File access error
                MsgBox "Cannot create folder. It may already exist.", vbExclamation
                Resume Next
            Case Else
                MsgBox "Error " & Err.Number & ": " & Err.Description, vbCritical
        End Select
    End Sub
    ```
    Avoid using `On Error Resume Next` without checking for errors afterward. This suppresses all errors but doesn't handle them, which can lead to unexpected behavior. Instead, use structured error handling with `On Error GoTo` and handle specific error cases appropriately.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Hardcoding Ranges and Values" icon="warning">
    ```vba
    ' Anti-pattern: Hardcoding ranges and values
    Sub GenerateReport()
        ' Hardcoded ranges
        Dim data As Range
        Set data = Sheets("Data").Range("A2:F100")
        
        ' Hardcoded column indices
        For i = 2 To 100
            If Sheets("Data").Cells(i, 3) > 1000 Then  ' Column C
                Sheets("Data").Cells(i, 6) = "High Value"  ' Column F
            End If
        Next i
    End Sub
    
    ' Better approach: Use named ranges and constants
    Sub GenerateReport()
        ' Use named ranges
        Dim data As Range
        Set data = Range("SalesData")
        
        ' Use constants for column indices
        Const COL_AMOUNT As Integer = 3  ' Column C
        Const COL_STATUS As Integer = 6  ' Column F
        Const HIGH_VALUE_THRESHOLD As Double = 1000
        
        For i = 2 To data.Rows.Count + 1
            If Sheets("Data").Cells(i, COL_AMOUNT) > HIGH_VALUE_THRESHOLD Then
                Sheets("Data").Cells(i, COL_STATUS) = "High Value"
            End If
        Next i
    End Sub
    ```
    Avoid hardcoding ranges, cell addresses, and magic numbers in your code. Instead, use named ranges, constants, and dynamic range determination. This makes your code more maintainable and adaptable to changes in the worksheet structure.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Inefficient Worksheet Loops" icon="warning">
    ```vba
    ' Anti-pattern: Inefficient worksheet interaction in loops
    Sub ProcessData()
        Dim i As Long
        Application.ScreenUpdating = True  ' Default is True
        
        For i = 1 To 10000
            Cells(i, 1).Value = i
            Cells(i, 2).Value = i * 2
            Cells(i, 3).Value = i * 3
        Next i
    End Sub
    
    ' Better approach: Optimize worksheet interaction
    Sub ProcessData()
        Dim i As Long
        Dim data() As Variant
        ReDim data(1 To 10000, 1 To 3)
        
        ' Work with arrays in memory
        For i = 1 To 10000
            data(i, 1) = i
            data(i, 2) = i * 2
            data(i, 3) = i * 3
        Next i
        
        ' Turn off screen updating before writing to worksheet
        Application.ScreenUpdating = False
        Range("A1:C10000").Value = data
        Application.ScreenUpdating = True
    End Sub
    ```
    Avoid inefficient worksheet interactions, especially in loops. Reading from or writing to worksheets is much slower than working with variables in memory. Use arrays to store and manipulate data, then update the worksheet in a single operation. Also, turn off screen updating during intensive operations to improve performance.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Proper Data Types" icon="warning">
    ```vba
    ' Anti-pattern: Using Variant for everything
    Sub ProcessNumbers()
        Dim i As Variant
        Dim sum As Variant
        Dim count As Variant
        
        sum = 0
        count = 0
        
        For i = 1 To 1000
            sum = sum + i
            count = count + 1
        Next i
        
        MsgBox "Average: " & sum / count
    End Sub
    
    ' Better approach: Use appropriate data types
    Sub ProcessNumbers()
        Dim i As Long
        Dim sum As Double
        Dim count As Long
        
        sum = 0
        count = 0
        
        For i = 1 To 1000
            sum = sum + i
            count = count + 1
        Next i
        
        MsgBox "Average: " & sum / count
    End Sub
    ```
    Use appropriate data types instead of relying on Variant. Variants are flexible but consume more memory and can be slower than specific data types. Use Integer or Long for whole numbers, Double for decimal numbers, String for text, and Boolean for true/false values.

                .AxisTitle.Text = "Sales"
            End With
        End With
    End Sub
    ```
    Use `With` blocks when setting multiple properties of the same object. This makes your code more readable and can improve performance by reducing the number of times the object needs to be evaluated.

    Avoid using VBA for calculations that can be done with Excel formulas. Excel's built-in formulas are optimized for performance and recalculate automatically when data changes. Use VBA for tasks that can't be easily accomplished with formulas, such as complex logic, file operations, or user interface interactions.

    ```
    Consider using early binding (setting references and declaring specific object types) when working with external applications like Word or Outlook. Early binding provides IntelliSense, compile-time type checking, and better performance. However, late binding (using Object type and CreateObject) can be more flexible when you need to support different versions of the external application.

    Use the appropriate loop construct for each situation. Use `For` loops when you know the number of iterations in advance, `For Each` loops when iterating through collections, and `Do While` or `Do Until` loops when you need to continue until a condition is met.

    Use meaningful comments to explain why your code does something, not what it does (which should be clear from the code itself). Include comments for procedure purposes, complex logic, and any non-obvious decisions. Also, use meaningful variable and procedure names to make your code self-documenting.

    ```
    Use explicit workbook and worksheet references instead of relying on the active workbook or worksheet. This makes your code more reliable and less dependent on the user's current selection. Use `ThisWorkbook` to refer to the workbook containing the code, and declare worksheet variables for clarity.

    Properly manage application settings like ScreenUpdating, EnableEvents, and Calculation to improve performance during intensive operations. Always save the original settings and restore them when your procedure finishes, even if an error occurs.
