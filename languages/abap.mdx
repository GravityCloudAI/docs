  <Accordion title="ABAP Anti-Patterns Overview" icon="abap">
    ABAP, despite being a powerful language for SAP development, has several common anti-patterns that can lead to performance issues, maintainability problems, and bugs. Here are the most important anti-patterns to avoid when writing ABAP code.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="SELECT * FROM Database Tables" icon="warning">
    ```abap
    " Anti-pattern: Using SELECT *
    SELECT * FROM scarr INTO TABLE lt_carriers.
    
    " Better approach: Select only needed fields
    SELECT carrid carrname currcode
      FROM scarr
      INTO TABLE lt_carriers.
    ```
    Avoid using `SELECT *` to retrieve all fields from database tables. This increases network traffic, memory usage, and processing time. Instead, explicitly list only the fields you need for your application logic.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using WHERE Clause in Database Queries" icon="warning">
    ```abap
    " Anti-pattern: No WHERE clause, filtering in ABAP
    SELECT carrid carrname currcode
      FROM scarr
      INTO TABLE lt_carriers.
    
    LOOP AT lt_carriers INTO ls_carrier
      WHERE currcode = 'USD'.
      " Process USD carriers
    ENDLOOP.
    
    " Better approach: Filter at database level
    SELECT carrid carrname currcode
      FROM scarr
      INTO TABLE lt_carriers
      WHERE currcode = 'USD'.
    
    LOOP AT lt_carriers INTO ls_carrier.
      " Process USD carriers
    ENDLOOP.
    ```
    Always use appropriate WHERE clauses in your database queries to filter data at the database level. Retrieving all records and then filtering them in ABAP is inefficient, especially for large tables.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using SELECT Inside Loops" icon="warning">
    ```abap
    " Anti-pattern: SELECT inside loop
    SELECT carrid carrname
      FROM scarr
      INTO TABLE lt_carriers.
    
    LOOP AT lt_carriers INTO ls_carrier.
      SELECT COUNT(*)
        FROM spfli
        WHERE carrid = ls_carrier-carrid
        INTO lv_count.
      
      ls_carrier-flight_count = lv_count.
      MODIFY lt_carriers FROM ls_carrier.
    ENDLOOP.
    
    " Better approach: Use JOIN or nested SELECT
    SELECT s~carrid s~carrname COUNT(*) AS flight_count
      FROM scarr AS s
      LEFT OUTER JOIN spfli AS p ON s~carrid = p~carrid
      GROUP BY s~carrid s~carrname
      INTO TABLE lt_carriers.
    ```
    Avoid executing database queries inside loops. This can lead to the "N+1 query problem" and severely impact performance. Instead, use JOINs, nested SELECTs, or FOR ALL ENTRIES to retrieve related data in a single query.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Internal Tables Effectively" icon="warning">
    ```abap
    " Anti-pattern: Inefficient internal table operations
    DATA: lt_data TYPE TABLE OF ty_data,
          ls_data TYPE ty_data.
    
    " Inefficient: Appending in a loop
    DO 1000 TIMES.
      ls_data-id = sy-index.
      ls_data-value = 'Value'.
      APPEND ls_data TO lt_data.
    ENDDO.
    
    " Better approach: Use APPEND INITIAL LINE or table expressions
    DO 1000 TIMES.
      APPEND INITIAL LINE TO lt_data ASSIGNING <fs_data>.
      <fs_data>-id = sy-index.
      <fs_data>-value = 'Value'.
    ENDDO.
    
    " Or even better in modern ABAP
    lt_data = VALUE #( FOR i = 1 UNTIL i > 1000 ( id = i value = 'Value' ) ).
    ```
    Use internal tables efficiently. Avoid operations like APPEND inside loops for large datasets. Instead, use APPEND INITIAL LINE with field symbols, table expressions, or modern ABAP constructs like VALUE operator for better performance.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Excessive Use of Global Variables" icon="warning">
    ```abap
    " Anti-pattern: Using global variables
    REPORT zprogram.
    
    DATA: gv_id TYPE i,
          gv_name TYPE string,
          gt_data TYPE TABLE OF ty_data.
    
    START-OF-SELECTION.
      PERFORM get_data.
      PERFORM process_data.
      PERFORM display_results.
    
    FORM get_data.
      SELECT * FROM ztable INTO TABLE gt_data.
    ENDFORM.
    
    FORM process_data.
      " Uses global gt_data
    ENDFORM.
    
    " Better approach: Pass parameters between procedures
    REPORT zprogram.
    
    START-OF-SELECTION.
      DATA: lt_data TYPE TABLE OF ty_data.
      
      PERFORM get_data CHANGING lt_data.
      PERFORM process_data USING lt_data.
      PERFORM display_results USING lt_data.
    
    FORM get_data CHANGING pt_data TYPE ty_table.
      SELECT * FROM ztable INTO TABLE pt_data.
    ENDFORM.
    
    FORM process_data USING pt_data TYPE ty_table.
      " Uses parameter pt_data
    ENDFORM.
    ```
    Avoid excessive use of global variables. They create hidden dependencies between procedures, make code harder to test and maintain, and can lead to unexpected behavior. Instead, pass parameters between procedures and use local variables when possible.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using ABAP Objects" icon="warning">
    ```abap
    " Anti-pattern: Procedural programming for complex logic
    REPORT zprogram.

    ```
    Use ABAP Objects (classes and interfaces) for complex applications instead of procedural programming with FORM routines. Object-oriented programming provides better encapsulation, reusability, and maintainability.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Hardcoding Values" icon="warning">
    ```abap
    " Anti-pattern: Hardcoding values
    SELECT * FROM sflight
      INTO TABLE lt_flights
      WHERE carrid = 'LH'
        AND connid = '0400'.
    
    IF sy-subrc = 0.
      " Process flights
    ENDIF.
    
    " Better approach: Use constants and configuration
    CONSTANTS: lc_carrier_id TYPE s_carr_id VALUE 'LH',
               lc_connection_id TYPE s_conn_id VALUE '0400'.
    
    " Even better: Use customizing tables
    SELECT single carrier connection
      FROM zconfig
      INTO (lv_carrier, lv_connection)
      WHERE config_id = 'DEFAULT'.
    
    SELECT * FROM sflight
      INTO TABLE lt_flights
      WHERE carrid = lv_carrier
        AND connid = lv_connection.
    ```
    Avoid hardcoding values in your code. Use constants, configuration tables, or customizing settings instead. This makes your code more maintainable and adaptable to different environments or requirements.

  <Accordion title="Not Using Proper Exception Handling" icon="warning">
    ```abap
    " Anti-pattern: No exception handling
    METHOD create_order.

            EXPORTING
              previous = lx_system.
      ENDTRY.
    ENDMETHOD.
    ```
    Use proper exception handling in your code. Catch specific exceptions rather than generic ones, and handle them appropriately. Use class-based exceptions (CX_* classes) for better error information and propagation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Modern ABAP Syntax" icon="warning">
    ```abap
    " Anti-pattern: Old ABAP syntax
    DATA: lv_value TYPE string,

      CONCATENATE 'Value:' ls_data-value INTO lv_value.
      WRITE: / lv_value.
    ENDLOOP.
    
    " Better approach: Use modern ABAP syntax
    DATA(lt_table) = VALUE ty_table( ).
    
    SELECT * FROM ztable INTO TABLE @lt_table.
    
    LOOP AT lt_table ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<ls_data>) WHERE id > 100.
      DATA(lv_value) = |Value: { <ls_data>-value }|.
      WRITE: / lv_value.
    ENDLOOP.
    ```
    Use modern ABAP syntax features like inline declarations, string templates, table expressions, and field symbols. Modern syntax is often more concise, readable, and can improve performance.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Inefficient String Handling" icon="warning">
    ```abap
    " Anti-pattern: Inefficient string concatenation
    DATA: lv_result TYPE string.
    
    DO 100 TIMES.
      CONCATENATE lv_result 'Item' sy-index INTO lv_result.
    ENDDO.
    
    " Better approach: Use string templates and efficient concatenation
    DATA: lv_result TYPE string,
          lt_parts TYPE TABLE OF string.
    
    DO 100 TIMES.
      APPEND |Item{ sy-index }| TO lt_parts.
    ENDDO.
    
    CONCATENATE LINES OF lt_parts INTO lv_result.
    
    " Or use string templates directly
    lv_result = |Item1Item2Item3...|.
    ```
    Use efficient string handling techniques. Avoid repeated CONCATENATE operations in loops. Instead, collect strings in a table and concatenate them at once, or use string templates (|...|) for simple concatenations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Code Inspector and ATC" icon="warning">
    ```abap
    " Anti-pattern: Not checking code quality
    " Writing code without static analysis
    
    " Better approach: Use Code Inspector and ATC
    " Run Code Inspector checks regularly
    " Set up ATC (ABAP Test Cockpit) for continuous code quality checks
    ```
    Always use Code Inspector and ABAP Test Cockpit (ATC) to check your code for performance issues, security vulnerabilities, and adherence to coding standards. These tools can identify many common anti-patterns automatically.
