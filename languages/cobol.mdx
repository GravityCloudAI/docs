  <Accordion title="COBOL Anti-Patterns Overview" icon="cobol">
    COBOL, despite its longevity and importance in business applications, has several common anti-patterns that can lead to maintainability problems and bugs. Here are the most important anti-patterns to avoid when writing COBOL code.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using GO TO Excessively" icon="warning">
    ```cobol
    * Anti-pattern: Excessive use of GO TO
    PROCEDURE DIVISION.
       PERFORM INITIALIZE-ROUTINE.
       GO TO PROCESS-DATA.
    
    INITIALIZE-ROUTINE.
       MOVE ZEROS TO TOTAL-AMOUNT.
       MOVE SPACES TO ERROR-MESSAGE.
    
    PROCESS-DATA.
       READ INPUT-FILE
          AT END GO TO END-OF-FILE
       END-READ.
       
       IF AMOUNT-FIELD > 1000
          GO TO LARGE-AMOUNT-ROUTINE
       ELSE
          GO TO SMALL-AMOUNT-ROUTINE
       END-IF.
    
    LARGE-AMOUNT-ROUTINE.
       ADD AMOUNT-FIELD TO LARGE-TOTAL.
       GO TO PROCESS-DATA.
    
    SMALL-AMOUNT-ROUTINE.
       ADD AMOUNT-FIELD TO SMALL-TOTAL.
       GO TO PROCESS-DATA.
    
    END-OF-FILE.
       DISPLAY "Processing complete".
       STOP RUN.
    
    * Better approach: Structured programming
    PROCEDURE DIVISION.
       PERFORM INITIALIZE-ROUTINE.
       PERFORM PROCESS-DATA UNTIL END-OF-FILE.
       DISPLAY "Processing complete".
       STOP RUN.
    
    INITIALIZE-ROUTINE.
       MOVE ZEROS TO TOTAL-AMOUNT.
       MOVE SPACES TO ERROR-MESSAGE.
    
    PROCESS-DATA.
       READ INPUT-FILE
          AT END SET END-OF-FILE TO TRUE
          NOT AT END PERFORM PROCESS-RECORD
       END-READ.
    
    PROCESS-RECORD.
       IF AMOUNT-FIELD > 1000
          PERFORM LARGE-AMOUNT-ROUTINE
       ELSE
          PERFORM SMALL-AMOUNT-ROUTINE
       END-IF.
    
    LARGE-AMOUNT-ROUTINE.
       ADD AMOUNT-FIELD TO LARGE-TOTAL.
    
    SMALL-AMOUNT-ROUTINE.
       ADD AMOUNT-FIELD TO SMALL-TOTAL.
    ```
    Avoid excessive use of `GO TO` statements, which create spaghetti code that is difficult to understand and maintain. Use structured programming constructs like `PERFORM`, `IF-ELSE`, and `EVALUATE` instead.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Magic Numbers" icon="warning">
    ```cobol
    * Anti-pattern: Using magic numbers
    IF CUSTOMER-TYPE = 1
       COMPUTE DISCOUNT = TOTAL-AMOUNT * 0.10
    ELSE IF CUSTOMER-TYPE = 2
       COMPUTE DISCOUNT = TOTAL-AMOUNT * 0.15
    ELSE IF CUSTOMER-TYPE = 3
       COMPUTE DISCOUNT = TOTAL-AMOUNT * 0.20
    END-IF.
    
    * Better approach: Use named constants
    01 DISCOUNT-RATES.
       05 REGULAR-CUSTOMER-RATE     PIC 9V99 VALUE 0.10.
       05 PREFERRED-CUSTOMER-RATE   PIC 9V99 VALUE 0.15.
       05 PREMIUM-CUSTOMER-RATE     PIC 9V99 VALUE 0.20.
    
    01 CUSTOMER-TYPES.
       05 REGULAR-CUSTOMER          PIC 9 VALUE 1.
       05 PREFERRED-CUSTOMER        PIC 9 VALUE 2.
       05 PREMIUM-CUSTOMER          PIC 9 VALUE 3.
    
    * In PROCEDURE DIVISION
    IF CUSTOMER-TYPE = REGULAR-CUSTOMER
       COMPUTE DISCOUNT = TOTAL-AMOUNT * REGULAR-CUSTOMER-RATE
    ELSE IF CUSTOMER-TYPE = PREFERRED-CUSTOMER
       COMPUTE DISCOUNT = TOTAL-AMOUNT * PREFERRED-CUSTOMER-RATE
    ELSE IF CUSTOMER-TYPE = PREMIUM-CUSTOMER
       COMPUTE DISCOUNT = TOTAL-AMOUNT * PREMIUM-CUSTOMER-RATE
    END-IF.
    ```
    Avoid using magic numbers (hardcoded numeric literals) in your code. Use named constants to make your code more readable and maintainable.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using Structured Data" icon="warning">
    ```cobol
    * Anti-pattern: Flat data structures
    01 CUSTOMER-RECORD.
       05 CUSTOMER-ID           PIC X(10).
       05 CUSTOMER-NAME         PIC X(30).
       05 CUSTOMER-ADDRESS-1    PIC X(30).
       05 CUSTOMER-ADDRESS-2    PIC X(30).

       05 CUSTOMER-ZIP          PIC X(10).
       05 CUSTOMER-PHONE        PIC X(15).
       05 CUSTOMER-EMAIL        PIC X(50).
    
    * Better approach: Use hierarchical data structures
    01 CUSTOMER-RECORD.
       05 CUSTOMER-ID           PIC X(10).
       05 CUSTOMER-NAME         PIC X(30).
       05 CUSTOMER-ADDRESS.
          10 STREET-ADDRESS-1   PIC X(30).
          10 STREET-ADDRESS-2   PIC X(30).
          10 CITY               PIC X(20).
          10 STATE              PIC X(2).
          10 ZIP-CODE           PIC X(10).
       05 CUSTOMER-CONTACT.
          10 PHONE-NUMBER       PIC X(15).
          10 EMAIL-ADDRESS      PIC X(50).
    ```
    Use hierarchical data structures to organize related data fields. This makes your code more readable and easier to maintain, especially when passing data between program modules.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Hardcoding File Names" icon="warning">
    ```cobol
    * Anti-pattern: Hardcoded file names
    SELECT CUSTOMER-FILE
       ASSIGN TO "C:\DATA\CUSTOMER.DAT"
       ORGANIZATION IS INDEXED
       ACCESS MODE IS DYNAMIC
       RECORD KEY IS CUSTOMER-ID.
    
    * Better approach: Use configuration files or environment variables
    SELECT CUSTOMER-FILE
       ASSIGN TO CUSTOMER-FILE-PATH
       ORGANIZATION IS INDEXED
       ACCESS MODE IS DYNAMIC
       RECORD KEY IS CUSTOMER-ID.

    IF CUSTOMER-FILE-PATH = SPACES
       MOVE "C:\DATA\CUSTOMER.DAT" TO CUSTOMER-FILE-PATH
    END-IF.
    ```
    Avoid hardcoding file paths and names in your programs. Use configuration files or environment variables instead, which makes your code more flexible and portable across different environments.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Validating Input Data" icon="warning">
    ```cobol
    * Anti-pattern: Not validating input
    ACCEPT CUSTOMER-ID.
    READ CUSTOMER-FILE
       INVALID KEY DISPLAY "Customer not found"
    END-READ.
    
    * Better approach: Validate input data
    ACCEPT CUSTOMER-ID.
    
    * Validate input format
    IF CUSTOMER-ID IS NOT NUMERIC
       DISPLAY "Error: Customer ID must be numeric"
       EXIT PARAGRAPH
    END-IF.
    
    IF CUSTOMER-ID = ZEROS
       DISPLAY "Error: Customer ID cannot be zero"
       EXIT PARAGRAPH
    END-IF.
    
    * Proceed with valid input
    READ CUSTOMER-FILE
       INVALID KEY DISPLAY "Customer not found"
    END-READ.
    ```
    Always validate input data before processing it. This helps prevent runtime errors, data corruption, and potential security issues.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using PERFORM THRU" icon="warning">
    ```cobol
    * Anti-pattern: Using PERFORM THRU
    PROCEDURE DIVISION.
       PERFORM INITIALIZE-ROUTINE THRU INITIALIZE-EXIT.
       PERFORM PROCESS-DATA THRU PROCESS-EXIT.
       STOP RUN.

       ADD AMOUNT-FIELD TO TOTAL-AMOUNT.
       GO TO PROCESS-DATA.
    PROCESS-EXIT.
       EXIT.
    
    * Better approach: Use structured PERFORM statements
    PROCEDURE DIVISION.
       PERFORM INITIALIZE-ROUTINE.
       PERFORM PROCESS-DATA UNTIL END-OF-FILE.
       STOP RUN.
    
    INITIALIZE-ROUTINE.

          AT END SET END-OF-FILE TO TRUE
          NOT AT END ADD AMOUNT-FIELD TO TOTAL-AMOUNT
       END-READ.
    ```
    Avoid using `PERFORM THRU` statements, which can lead to maintenance issues if paragraphs are reordered or renamed. Use structured `PERFORM` statements with well-defined paragraph boundaries instead.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not Using COPY Books" icon="warning">
    ```cobol
    * Anti-pattern: Duplicating data definitions
    * In Program A
    01 CUSTOMER-RECORD.

          10 ZIP-CODE           PIC X(10).
    
    * Better approach: Use COPY books
    * In CUSTOMER.CPY file
    01 CUSTOMER-RECORD.
       05 CUSTOMER-ID           PIC X(10).
       05 CUSTOMER-NAME         PIC X(30).

          10 ZIP-CODE           PIC X(10).
    
    * In Program A and Program B
    COPY CUSTOMER.
    ```
    Use COPY books to share common data definitions and code across multiple programs. This reduces duplication and ensures consistency.

  <Accordion title="Not Using Meaningful Variable Names" icon="warning">
    ```cobol
    * Anti-pattern: Cryptic variable names

    01 X3              PIC 9(5)V99.
    
    COMPUTE X3 = X1 * X2.
    
    * Better approach: Descriptive variable names
    01 ITEM-PRICE      PIC 9(5)V99.
    01 QUANTITY        PIC 9(5)V99.
    01 TOTAL-COST      PIC 9(5)V99.
    
    COMPUTE TOTAL-COST = ITEM-PRICE * QUANTITY.

    Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, paragraphs, and sections. This makes your code more readable and easier to understand and maintain.

          10 FILLER             PIC 9(2).
    
    * Better approach: Use separate fields for different purposes
    01 CUSTOMER-DATA.
       05 CUSTOMER-ID           PIC 9(10).
       05 CUSTOMER-NAME         PIC X(30).

          10 REG-DAY            PIC 9(2).
    ```
    Avoid using `REDEFINES` to repurpose the same memory location for different data types. This can lead to data corruption and maintenance issues. Use separate fields for different purposes instead.
