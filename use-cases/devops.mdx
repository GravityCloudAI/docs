## Stacks - Automation

<Note>Save 30% DevOps time and effort using Matter AI</Note>

Matter AI Stacks are your go-to customisable modules to create and launch resources on cloud platforms. This can include:
- VPC
- AWS ECS Services
- Kubernetes Clusters
- Databases
- Queues
and more...

## Stacks - Creation

Gravity Stacks can be anything. Below is an example to create and launch a new ECS service using Github repository:

/>

1. Connect Github Repo & Select branch
2. Create or Select ECS cluster
3. Select workload configuration such as Region, VPC, CPU, RAM or GPU
4. Enable auto-scaling

/>

5. Provide service level details such as Name, Port, Healthcheck etc
6. Configure ENV variables in Key-Value editor or copy the .env file into YAML editor. These ENV variables can be stored in KMS or Gravity Vault
7. Launch your service on ECS!

## Stacks - Management

Similar to launching new resources, existing cloud resources can also be managed with ease, such as:

- Total running workloads
- State for workloads
- Enabling CI/CD

## Stacks - Configurations

Previously created stacks OR auto-imported stacks from existing cloud resources can be re-configured anytime:

- Scale up or down your ECS services
- Modify and Update ENV Variable with automatic deployment triggers

This is one simple example that helps you create, launch and manage cloud resources without building internal tools for the same.
