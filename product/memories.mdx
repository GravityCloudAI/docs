title: 'Memories'
description: 'Memories are an advanced AI learning feature that enables Matter AI to automatically adapt and improve its code review capabilities based on your teams interactions and feedback. Unlike static rulesets, Memories dynamically evolve over time, learning from pull request comments, discussions, and code patterns specific to your organization.'

## How Memories Work

Memories function as a continuous learning system that captures and incorporates knowledge from your teams development process:

1. **Automatic Learning**: Matter AI observes interactions between developers during code reviews, capturing valuable insights about your teams preferences and standards.

2. **Pattern Recognition**: The system identifies recurring patterns in code reviews, comments, and discussions to understand what matters most to your team.

3. **Contextual Adaptation**: As more code reviews occur, Matter AI builds a deeper understanding of your codebase and organizational context.

4. **Feedback Integration**: The system incorporates explicit and implicit feedback from developers to refine its review approach.

5. **Continuous Improvement**: Over time, Matter AI becomes increasingly aligned with your teams specific needs and expectations.

## Key Features

### Organizational Learning

Memories capture and preserve organizational knowledge about code quality standards, best practices, and common pitfalls specific to your codebase. This creates a persistent knowledge base that grows with your team.

### Adaptive Reviews

As Matter AI learns from your teams interactions, it automatically adjusts its review focus, tone, and recommendations to better match your teams expectations and needs.

### Personalized Feedback

Memories enable Matter AI to tailor its feedback style to different teams, repositories, or even individual developers, providing more relevant and actionable suggestions.

### Institutional Knowledge Preservation

Memories serve as a repository of your teams collective wisdom, preserving insights that might otherwise be lost when team members transition or projects evolve.

## Advantages of Memories

### Reduced Onboarding Time

New team members benefit from AI reviews that already understand your organizations specific coding standards and practices, accelerating their integration into the team.

### Consistency Across Teams

Memories help maintain consistent code quality standards across different teams and projects within your organization, even as teams evolve over time.

### Continuous Improvement

Unlike static rules that require manual updates, Memories automatically evolve as your teams practices and standards mature, ensuring the AI reviewer stays aligned with your current needs.

### Knowledge Retention

Memories preserve valuable insights and best practices even as team members change, ensuring that organizational knowledge is maintained and accessible to all developers.

### Reduced Review Fatigue

As Matter AI becomes better aligned with your teams expectations, developers spend less time explaining or justifying review comments, making the entire review process more efficient.

### Learning from Human Expertise

Memories capture the nuanced expertise of your best developers, making their insights available to the entire team through AI-powered reviews.

## Managing Memories

While Memories operate largely autonomously, team administrators can:

- **View Learning Progress**: Monitor how Matter AI is adapting to your teams patterns over time
- **Prioritize Learning Areas**: Guide the system to focus on specific aspects of code review that matter most to your team
- **Reset or Refine**: If needed, adjust or reset certain learned patterns to better align with changing team priorities

## Getting Started with Memories

Memories begin learning automatically as soon as Matter AI starts reviewing your code. The more your team interacts with Matter AI through comments, discussions, and code changes, the more effectively it will learn your teams specific needs and preferences.

For optimal results, encourage your team to:

1. **Provide Clear Feedback**: When accepting or rejecting AI suggestions, briefly explain why
2. **Engage in Discussions**: Have meaningful conversations about code quality in PR comments
3. **Be Consistent**: Maintain consistent standards in your own reviews to help the AI learn effectively
