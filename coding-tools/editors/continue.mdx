Continue is a VS Code extension that provides AI-powered coding assistance. You can configure it to use Axon's AI capabilities for enhanced code generation and analysis.

## Obtain MatterAI API Key
Get your API Key from MatterAI console: [https://app.matterai.so/settings](https://app.matterai.so/settings)

## Configuration

To integrate Continue with Axon, configure the following settings in Continue's API Configuration:

<Frame>
<img
  className="block"
