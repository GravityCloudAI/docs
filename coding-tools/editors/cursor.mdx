</Tip>

Cline is a VS Code extension that provides AI-powered coding assistance. You can configure it to use Axon's AI capabilities for enhanced code generation and analysis.

## Obtain MatterAI API Key
Get your API Key from MatterAI console: [https://app.matterai.so/settings](https://app.matterai.so/settings)

## Configuration

To integrate Cline with Axon, configure the following settings in Cline's API Configuration:

The configuration provides a large context window (200,000 tokens) which is ideal for working with large codebases and maintaining context across extended coding sessions.
