<Tip>
Axon Coding Plan is currently in beta with free 10M tokens a week, collectively for all Axon Models
</Tip>

## Obtain MatterAI API Key
Get your API Key from MatterAI console: [https://app.matterai.so/settings](https://app.matterai.so/settings)

## Configuration

To integrate Axon models with Codex CLI, configure your `~/.codex/config.toml` file as following:

1. `vi ~/.codex/config.toml`

2. Add MatterAI as provider and `axon-code` model config:
```toml ~/.codex/config.toml lines icon="toml"
model = "axon-code"
model_provider = "matterai"
model_context_window = 256000
model_max_output_tokens = 32000

[profiles.matterai]
model = "axon-code"
provider = "matterai"

[model_providers.matterai]
name = "MatterAI"
base_url = "https://api.matterai.so/v1"
env_key = "MATTERAI_API_KEY"
wire_api = "chat"
```

3. Export `MATTERAI_API_KEY` in your environment
```
export MATTERAI_API_KEY=<your_matterai_api_key>
```
<Note>
This export is for the current shell, to always use it, please set in `~/.bashrc` OR `~/.zshrc` file
</Note>

4. Start using Codex
```
codex "explain this readme to me"
```
