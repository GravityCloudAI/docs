## What is AWS ECS?
Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. ECS supports Docker containers and allows you to run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances or with AWS Fargate, a serverless compute engine.
