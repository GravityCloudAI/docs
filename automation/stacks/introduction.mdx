## What are Stacks?

Stacks are your pre-built configurable cloud resource launchers. You can create basic resources from VPC, Databases, Queues to complex resources such as EKS clusters, ECS services without writing any code.

### Features
1. **Configurable**: Can be dynamically updated based on RBAC, Environments etc.
2. **Secure**: Follows all best practices from security groups, data encryption by default
3. **Repeatable**: Rerun stacks with changes without writing scripts
4. **Ephemeral**: Every stack run can have a teardown time to auto delete resources after an interval
5. **Audit**: Every stack run is logged into trail with status updates, slack alerts and timestamps
