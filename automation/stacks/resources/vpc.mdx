## What is VPC?

With Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), you can launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

## VPC Stack

Use Gravity **VPC Stack** to create a new Private VPC.

<Note>This stack contains 1 VPC with 2 private subnets with 1 NAT Gateway and 2 public subnets with 1 Internet Gateway.</Note>

2. Enter the `VPC Name` (this can be changed later)
3. `Select the Region` you want the VPC to be created in (cannot be changed later)
4. Enter the `IPv4 CIDR block` (confirm for non-conflicting values)
5. `Add tags`, basic tags for user are automatically added along with `Source:GravityCloud`
6. Click on `Run Stack â†’`

<Check>It takes 5-10 mins to provision all the required resources for the VPC. Upon completion, you'll get a Slack Notification</Check>
